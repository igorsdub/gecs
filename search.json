    "text": "WSL (Windows users only)\nBeing a popular operating system doesn’t make Windows easy to use for software development. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) circumvents this problem by creating a separate environment on your computer to run Linux, a free UNIX-like OS.\n\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you experiencing some troubles if installation it is worth:\n\nUpdating your Windows version. Open Windows Settings, go to ‘Updates and Security’ and hit ‘Check for Updates’.\nEnable WSL on your Windows manually.\n\nClick on the Start Menu and search for “Turn Windows features on or off”.\nOpen the result. A new window will appear with a list of Windows features.\nScroll down and check the following two boxes:\n\n‘Windows Subsystem for Linux’ ✅\n‘Virtual Machine Platform’ ✅\n\nClick OK. Windows will apply the changes and may ask you to restart your computer.\nAfter restarting, WSL will be enabled on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 1: Microsoft Store\nhttps://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2022/11/windows-subsystem-for-linux-microsoft-store-ga-and-now-default-wsl/\n\nSearch for “WSL” in the search bar of the Microsoft Store and click Install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf WSL is not available from the Microsoft Store, proceed to Option 2 below. If it is available, you might need to restart your computer after installing WSL.\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing WSL from the Microsoft Store, click the Open option to open the app. It will finish the installation of Ubuntu and prompt you to set up your Linux user.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can search “Ubuntu” in the Microsoft Store and install it directly from there.\nVideo guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqCPkcRoMF0\n\n\n\nFrom the PowerShell\n\nOpen the Start Menu, and search for “PowerShell”.\nRight-click and choose “Run as administrator”.\nEnter the following command to install WSL and hit Enter:\nwsl --install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantYou might need to restart your computer after installing WSL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, Ubuntu will be installed as the main Linux distribution. WSL will appear in your Start Menu and the Search Bar options.\n\n\nCreating a Default UNIX User Account\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you set a username on your computer, sign up for a GitHub account (see Section 3.1) and check if that username is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUsername and password suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a username: - Use only lower-case letters and numbers. - Start with a letter. - Be short and descriptive.\nIf your name is John Derek Smith you can try: jsmith, jdsmith, or johnsmith. Any other imaginary name is permissible as long as it meets the criteria above. D&D, MTG, LoL, and WoW nicknames, if that’s is publically appropriate.\nFor a password, you can set the same one you have for your OIST account to make it easier to remember. It will be used for login and authentication but, more importantly, commands like sudo that grant administrative priviledges. If not sure what makes a strong password consult XKCD.\n\n\n\n\nLaunch Ubuntu terminal\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a username.\n\n\nEnter your chosen username and hit Enter. If you make a mistake in typing your username, you can close the window and open it again. In this example, tunkert is the username.\n\n\nChoose a password. You will not see it as you type due to default UNIX security reasons. If not sure what you entered is correct, hold Backspace for a couple of seconds or hit Ctrl+U. That will erase everything you have written. After making sure you have entered the correct password, hit Enter. If unsure, write the password down.\n\n\n\nRe-type the chosen password and hit Enter.\n\n\n\nOnce both username and password are entered, you will see a welcome message from Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe typing line takes the new form of tunkert@LAPTOP-JU9CGB60:~$. Can you guess what the name after @ means? We will talk about what each symbol means in the terminal section.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that Ubuntu is up-to-date, type the following and press Enter:\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will understand the logic behind this command later in the next section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter the password (Do you remember?). Enter the password—you will not see it—and press Enter.\n\n\n\nThe update will begin. In the end, you will have an empty typing line with the latest Ubuntu.\n\n\nYou are now set and ready to install all the wonderful programming tools that have been developed over the past 50 or so years by the developer’s community. As you might guess, there are hundreds of thousands of programs out there, and ideally, we would like to keep track of what we install. That will be our next installation.",

Speaking of VS Code profiles: we will use one tailored for this course.\n\n\nExtensions\nThe biggest power of VS Code lies in its extensions. They are ubiquitous allowing you to boost your IDE simply by installing what others have solved for you. You can browse them by clicking on the four cube icon on the side bar or by pressing Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+X.\n\nThere are certain basic extensions that almost every VS Code user will have installed but it can be cumbersome to manually select all those one by one.
