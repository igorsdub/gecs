    "section": "WSL (Windows users only)",
    "text": "WSL (Windows users only)\nBeing a popular operating system doesn’t make Windows easy to use for software development. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) circumvents this problem by creating a separate environment on your computer to run Linux, a free UNIX-like OS. We will install Linux with a particular flavour called Ubuntu. Right now, we will not go into details. All you need to know is that by the end of this installation you will be free to use a vast majority of scientific software available on the web.\n\nInstallation\nThere are two ways to install WSL with Ubuntu: graphical and terminal. The graphical method uses the Microsoft Store and should be straightforward. The terminal method uses PowerShell and is less user-friendly but more robust to errors. Choose whichever suits you best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTroubleshooting WSL\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re experiencing some troubles with installation, it is worth:\n\nUpdating your Windows version. Open Windows Settings, go to ‘Updates and Security’ and hit ‘Check for Updates’.\nEnable WSL on your Windows manually.\n\nClick on the Start Menu and search for “Turn Windows features on or off”.\nOpen the result. A new window will appear with a list of Windows features.\nScroll down and check the following two boxes:\n\n‘Windows Subsystem for Linux’ ✅\n‘Virtual Machine Platform’ ✅\n\nClick OK. Windows will apply the changes and may ask you to restart your computer.\nAfter restarting, WSL will be enabled on your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Microsoft Store\n\nSearch for “WSL” in the search bar of the Microsoft Store and click Install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf WSL is not available from the Microsoft Store, proceed to Section 1.1.1.2 below. If it is available, you might need to restart your computer after installing WSL.\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing WSL from the Microsoft Store, click the Open option to open the app. It will finish the installation of Ubuntu and prompt you to set up your Linux user.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can search “Ubuntu” in the Microsoft Store and install it directly from there.\nVideo guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqCPkcRoMF0\n\n\nFrom the PowerShell\n\nOpen the Start Menu, and search for “PowerShell”.\nRight-click and choose “Run as administrator”.\nEnter the following command to install WSL and hit Enter:\nwsl --install\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might need to restart your computer after installing WSL.\n\n\n\nBy default, Ubuntu will be installed as the main Linux distribution. WSL will appear in your Start Menu and the Search Bar options.\n\n\n\nCreating a Default UNIX User Account\nNow, that you have Ubuntu installed, you need to create an account in order to start using it. Generally it is called a “UNIX User Account” but a “Ubuntu account” would do as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore you set a username on your computer, sign up for a GitHub account (see Section 4.1) and check if that username is available. This unity in names will make it easier for you to orient your files and folder,as well establish a virtual nickname that you can use consistently in the future projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUsername and password suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a username: - Use only lower-case letters and numbers. - Start with a letter. - Be short and descriptive.\nIf your name is John Derek Smith you can try: jsmith, jdsmith, or johnsmith. Any other imaginary name is permissible as long as it meets the criteria above. D&D, MTG, LoL, and WoW nicknames, if that’s is publically appropriate.\nFor a password, you can set the same one you have for your OIST account to make it easier to remember. It will be used for login and authentication but, more importantly, commands like sudo that grant administrative priviledges. If not sure what makes a strong password consult XKCD.\n\n\n\n\nLaunch Ubuntu terminal\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter a username.\n\n\nEnter your chosen username and hit Enter. If you make a mistake in typing your username, you can close the window and open it again. In this example, tunkert is the username.\n\n\nChoose a password. You will not see it as you type due to default UNIX security reasons. If not sure what you entered is correct, hold Backspace for a couple of seconds or hit Ctrl+U. That will erase everything you have written. After making sure you have entered the correct password, hit Enter. If unsure, write the password down.\n\n\n\nRe-type the chosen password and hit Enter.\n\n\n\nOnce both username and password are entered, you will see a welcome message from Ubuntu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe typing line takes the new form of tunkert@LAPTOP-JU9CGB60:~$. Can you guess what the name after @ means? We will talk about what each symbol means in the terminal section.\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure that Ubuntu is up-to-date, type the following and press Enter:\n\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will understand the logic behind this command later in the next section as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to enter the password (Do you remember?). Enter the password—you will not see it—and press Enter.\n\n\n\nThe update will begin. In the end, you will have an empty typing line with the latest Ubuntu.\n\n\nYou are now set and ready to install all the wonderful programming tools that have been developed over the past 50 or so years by the developer’s community. As you might guess, there are hundreds of thousands of programs out there, and ideally, we would like to keep track of what we install. That will be our next installation.",

Agree and see Section 2.1.2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\nThe biggest power of VS Code lies in its extensions. They are ubiquitous allowing you to boost your IDE simply by installing what others have solved for you. You can browse them by clicking on the four cube icon on the side bar or by pressing Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+X.\n\nThere are certain basic extensions that almost every VS Code user will have installed but it can be cumbersome to manually select all those one by one. That’s how VS Code Profiles have been created.\n\nWSL Extenison (Windows users only)\nWindows user will need one more step before they can start using VS Code at its full potential. Right now, you open VS Code and all files and computation is done in Windows environment. We want VS Code to use Ubuntu that lives in WSL. Using the Visual Studio Code WSL extension VS Code will integrate Ubuntu into its environment.\nOnce the extension is installed you need to open VS Code with Ubuntu as the main environment. To do that, locate a button in the left-bottom corner of the VS Code window consisting of two stacked arrow symbols ‘&gt;’ and ‘&lt;’. Click on it.\n\nAfter clicking on this button, a promt line will appear on the top of the window. Select WSL: New WSL Window and press Enter.\n\nA new window will open. This time, notice that the corner button has changed. Now, we are running on Ubuntu.\n\nWindows users will use this environment for the course.\n\n\n\nProfiles\n\nProfiles can be used to customize VS Code for students to ease the use in a classroom setting. Profiles allow educators to quickly share a customized VS Code setup with students.\nVS Code manual\n\n\nYou can access the Profiles editor in either of the following ways: - From the Code &gt; Settings &gt; Profiles menu item\n\nFrom the Manage gear button in the bottom of the Activity Bar.\n\n\nYou will see that the Default profile is in use. We will import the GECS profile for this course. The profile file is stored on GitHub (one of its nice features). That code is shown below.\n\nHowever, you don’t need to copy it, only need the link.\nhttps://gist.github.com/igorsdub/04f6a1191dde8e09091a1099fe87d5be.js\nImport the GECS profile from the Profiles editor by selecting the Import Profile… button in the dropdown actions of the New Profile button.\n\nWhen you select Import Profile…, you are prompted for the URL of a GitHub gist or the file location of a profile via an Import Profile dialog. Paste the link above and click Create button below.\n\n\n\nAccept any installations or suggestions offered by extensions. Now, you are ready to go!",

Now, you are able to access a much larger range of applications which are inaccessible to graphical user interface (GUI) users.\n\n\n\nWe will use the VS Code’s terminal to do the installation. To open the terminal select View &gt; Terminal from the menu bar, or by pressing the Ctrl/Cmd+` keyboard shortcut. A terminal window will open at the bottom.\n\nTo install Pixi run the following command in your terminal:\ncurl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh\nTo verify that Pixi got installed successfully type:\nwhich pixi\nYou will see something like /Users/username/.pixi/bin/pixi printed, where username is your chosen username.",
