The biggest concern that every reseracher using software faces is to rememer how to run a program, fix broken parts wihout affecting the working ones, and experiment by adding new features. Version control can do that! Although, the learning curve is steep your future self will think: "How no one has taught me this before?!"

Jimmy and Alfredo have been hired by Ratatouille restaurant to investigate if it is possible to make the best recipes archive ever. They want to be able to work on indexing the prices at the same time, but they have run into problems doing this in the past. If they take turns, each one will spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if they work on their own copies and email changes back and forth things will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated.

Version control is better than mailing files back and forth:

-   Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at losing it. Since all old versions of files are saved, it's always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.

-   As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the "undo" feature in an editor.

-   When several people collaborate in the same project, it's possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes. The version control system automatically notifies users whenever there's a conflict between one person's work and another's.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).

**Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world**: it's what professionals use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

## Installing Git

You should have Git already installed in your distribution. Check it out by typing in your terminal:

``` bash
git --version
```

If you get an error, please see [this webpage](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git) from The Software Carpentries for instructions on installing Git for various operating systems.

## Creating GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, check the [Setting Up](00_setting-up.qmd) section.

## Preparing Your Working Directory

You can choose which directory you want to work in. If you have no preference, move to your home directory:

``` bash
cd
```

# Automated Version Control

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used to keep track of what one person did and when. Even if you aren't collaborating with other people, automated version control is much better than this situation:

![Comic: a PhD student sends "FINAL.doc" to their supervisor, but after several increasingly intense and frustrating rounds of comments and revisions they end up with a file named "FINAL_rev.22.comments49.corrections.10.#\@\$%WHYDIDCOMETOGRADSCHOOL????.doc"](images/03_version-control__phd101212s.png)

We've all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word's [Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a), Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.

![](images/03_version-control__play-changes.svg){alt="A diagram demonstrating how a single document grows as the result of sequential changes"}

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent sets of changes on the same document.

![](images/03_version-control__versions.svg){alt="A diagram with one source document that has been modified in two different ways to produce two different versions of the document"}

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

![](images/03_version-control__merge.svg){alt="A diagram that shows the merging of two different document versions into one document that contains all of the changes from both versions"}

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them, such as who made the change. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="minimal" title="The Long History of Version Control Systems"}
Automated version control systems are nothing new. Tools like [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System), [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), or [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies. However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., outdated) due to various limitations in their capabilities. More modern systems, such as [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial), are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository. These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work on the same files concurrently.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as an alternative to BitKeeper, one of the first distributed version control systems, to track changes in the Linux kernel. Torvalds provided several explanations of the name, of varying degrees of politeness, which are enumerated in the [project's README](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/README.md?plain=1#L55), including "Global Information Tacker" for when "you're in a good mood".

For those interested, The Carpentries has a [Version Control with Mercurial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/) lesson (2013-2018), which provides additional context and historical perspective.

# Setting Up Git

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

-   our name and email address,
-   what our preferred text editor is,
-   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`, where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how Alfredo sets up his new laptop:

``` bash
git config --global user.name "Alfredo Linguini"
git config --global user.email "a.linguini@ratatouille.fr"
```

Please use your own name and email address instead of Alfredo's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or another Git host server after this lesson will include this information.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/).

::: {.callout-note title="Keeping your email private"}
If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use GitHub's no-reply email address for the `user.email` value. It looks like `ID+username@users.noreply.github.com`. You can look up your own address in your GitHub [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Line Endings"}
As with other keys, when you press Enter on your keyboard, your computer encodes this input as a character. Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line. (You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.) Because Git uses these characters to compare files, it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines. Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue [in the Pro Git book](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf).

You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings using the `core.autocrlf` command to `git config`. The following settings are recommended:

On macOS and Linux:

``` bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

And on Windows:

``` bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
:::

Alfredo also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

::: {.callout-note title="Exiting Vim"}
Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving your changes, press Esc then type `:q!` and press Enter. If you want to save your changes and quit, press Esc then type `:wq` and press Enter.
:::

Git (2.28+) allows configuration of the name of the branch created when you initialize any new repository. Alfredo decides to use that feature to set it to `main` so it matches the cloud service he will eventually use.

``` bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

::: {.callout-note title="Default Git branch naming"}
Source file changes are associated with a "branch." For new learners in this lesson, it's enough to know that branches exist, and this lesson uses one branch. By default, Git will create a branch called `master` when you create a new repository with `git init` (as explained in the next episode). This term evokes the racist practice of human slavery and the [software development community](https://github.com/github/renaming) has moved to adopt more inclusive language.

In 2020, most Git code hosting services transitioned to using `main` as the default branch. As an example, any new repository that is opened in GitHub and GitLab default to `main`. However, Git has not yet made the same change. As a result, local repositories must be manually configured have the same main branch name as most cloud services.

For versions of Git prior to 2.28, the change can be made on an individual repository level. The command for this is in the next episode. Note that if this value is unset in your local Git configuration, the `init.defaultBranch` value defaults to `master`.
:::

The five commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

Let's review those settings and test our `core.editor` right away:

``` bash
git config --global --edit
```

Let's close the file without making any additional changes. Remember, since typos in the config file will cause issues, it's safer to view the configuration with:

``` bash
git config --list --global
```

And if necessary, change your configuration using the same commands to choose another editor or update your email address. This can be done as many times as you want.

::: {.callout-note title="Proxy"}
In some networks you need to use a [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you may also need to tell Git about the proxy:

``` bash
git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
```

To disable the proxy, use

``` bash
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Git Help and Manual"}
Always remember that if you forget the subcommands or options of a `git` command, you can access the relevant list of options typing `git <command> -h` or access the corresponding Git manual by typing `git <command> --help`, e.g.:

``` bash
git config -h
git config --help
```

While viewing the manual, remember the `:` is a prompt waiting for commands and you can press Q to exit the manual.

More generally, you can get the list of available `git` commands and further resources of the Git manual typing:

``` bash
git help
```
:::

# Creating a Repository


Once Git is configured, we can start using it.

We will help Alfredo with his new project, create a repository with all his recipes.

First, let's create a new directory in the home directory `~` for our work and then change the current working directory to the newly created one:

``` bash
cd 
mkdir recipes
cd recipes
```

Then we tell Git to make `recipes` a repository -- a place where Git can store versions of our files:

``` bash
git init
```

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that can include subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create separate repositories nested within the `recipes` repository, whether subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note that the creation of the `recipes` directory and its initialization as a repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents, it appears that nothing has changed:

``` bash
ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything, we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `recipes` called `.git`:

``` bash
ls -a
```

```output
.	..	.git
```

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, including the tracked files and sub-directories located within the project's directory. If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory, we will lose the project's history.

We can now start using one of the most important git commands, which is particularly helpful to beginners. `git status` tells us the status of our project, and better, a list of changes in the project and options on what to do with those changes. We can use it as often as we want, whenever we want to understand what is going on.

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact wording of the output might be slightly different.

## Places to Create Git Repositories

Along with tracking information about recipes (the project we have already created), Alfredo would also like to track information about desserts specifically. Alfredo creates a `desserts` project inside his `recipes` project with the following sequence of commands:

``` bash
cd              # return to the home directory
cd recipes      # go into recipes directory, which is already a Git repository
ls -a           # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the recipes directory
mkdir desserts  # make a sub-directory recipes/desserts
cd desserts     # go into desserts subdirectory
git init        # make the desserts subdirectory a Git repository
ls -a           # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command, run inside the `desserts` subdirectory, required for tracking files stored in the `desserts` subdirectory?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
No. Alfredo does not need to make the `desserts` subdirectory a Git repository because the `recipes` repository will track all files, sub-directories, and subdirectory files under the `recipes` directory. Thus, in order to track all information about desserts, Alfredo only needed to add the `desserts` subdirectory to the `recipes` directory.

Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are "nested": the outer repository will try to version-control the inner repository. Therefore, it's best to create each new Git repository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting repository in the directory, check the output of `git status`. If it looks like the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown above:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
:::

## Correcting `git init` Mistakes

Jimmy explains to Alfredo how a nested repository is redundant and may cause confusion down the road. Alfredo would like to go back to a single git repository. How can Alfredo undo his last `git init` in the `desserts` subdirectory?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution: USE WITH CAUTION!" collapse="true"}

**Background**

Removing files from a Git repository needs to be done with caution. But we have not learned yet how to tell Git to track a particular file; we will learn this in the next episode. Files that are not tracked by Git can easily be removed like any other "ordinary" files with

``` bash
rm filename
```

Similarly a directory can be removed using `rm -r dirname`. If the files or folder being removed in this fashion are tracked by Git, then their removal becomes another change that we will need to track, as we will see in the next episode.

**Solution**

Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory. To recover from this little mistake, Alfredo can remove the `.git` folder in the desserts subdirectory by running the following command from inside the `recipes` directory:

``` bash
rm -rf desserts/.git
```

But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory will remove the entire Git history of a project you might want to keep. In general, deleting files and directories using `rm` from the command line cannot be reversed. Therefore, always check your current directory using the command `pwd`.

:::

# Tracking Changes

First let's make sure we're still in the right directory. You should be in the `recipes` directory.

``` bash
cd
cd recipes
```

Let's create a file called `guacamole.md` that contains the basic structure of our first recipe. We'll use VS Code to edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like.

``` bash
code guacamole.md
```

If `code` is not working via terminal, you can just use GUI to create a new file by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl+N`.


Type the text below into the `guacamole.md` file:

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
## Instructions
```

Save the file and exit your editor.

::: {.callout-note title="Markdown" collapse="true"}
Jimmy and Alfredo are using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to write their recipes. It is a simple plain-text format for writing lists, links and other things that might go into a web page.

| Markdown code | Rendered output |
|---|---|
| `*   Use asterisks` `*   to create` `*   bullet lists.` | - Use asterisks - to create - bullet lists. |
| `1.   Use numbers` `1.   to create` `1.   numbered lists.` | 1. Use numbers 2. to create 3. numbered lists. |
| `*  You can use indents` `   *  To create sublists` `   *  of the same type` | - You can use indents   - To create sublists   - of the same type |
| `# A Level-1 Heading` | ## A Level-1 Heading |
| `## A Level-2 Heading` | ### A Level-2 Heading |
:::

Let's verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):

``` bash
ls
```

```output
guacamole.md
```

`guacamole.md` contains three lines, which we can see by running:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
## Instructions
```

If we check the status of our project again, Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	guacamole.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory that Git isn't keeping track of. We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
```

and then check that the right thing happened:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   guacamole.md
```

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `guacamole.md`, but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet. To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:

``` bash
git commit -m "Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe"
```

```output
[main (root-commit) f22b25e] Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 guacamole.md
```

When we run `git commit`, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add` and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory. This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`. Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message") to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git will launch VS Code editor (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`) so that we can write a longer message.

Good commit messages start with a brief (less than 50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>. If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

it tells us everything is up to date. If we want to know what we've done recently, we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

``` bash
git log
```

```output
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Alfredo Linguini <a.linguini@ratatouille.fr>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each commit includes the commit's full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier), the commit's author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

::: {.callout-note title="Where Are My Changes?"}
If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `guacamole.md`. That's because Git saves information about files' history in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).
:::

Now suppose Alfredo adds more information to the file. (Again, we'll edit with `code` and then `cat` the file to show its contents; you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lemon
* salt
## Instructions
```

When we run `git status` now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The last line is the key phrase: "no changes added to commit". We have changed this file, but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes (which we do with `git add`) nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`). So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`. This shows us the differences between the current state of the file and the most recently saved version:

``` bash
git diff
```

```output
diff --git a/guacamole.md b/guacamole.md
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/guacamole.md
+++ b/guacamole.md
@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@
 # Guacamole
 ## Ingredients
+* avocado
+* lemon
+* salt
 ## Instructions
```

The output is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch` telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we break it down into pieces:

1. The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2. The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing; `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3. The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4. The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

``` bash
git commit -m "Add ingredients for basic guacamole"
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Whoops: Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first. Let's fix that:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git commit -m "Add ingredients for basic guacamole"
```

```output
[main 34961b1] Add ingredients for basic guacamole
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than only large batches. For example, suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis. We might want to commit those additions, and the corresponding bibliography entries, but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion (which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this, Git has a special *staging area* where it keeps track of things that have been added to the current changeset but not yet committed.

::: {.callout-note title="Staging Area"}
If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project, `git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area), and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). If you don't have anything staged when you type `git commit`, Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`, which is kind of like gathering *everyone* to take a group photo! However, it's almost always better to explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might commit changes you forgot you made. Try to stage things manually, or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more than you would like!
:::

![](images/03_version-control__git-staging-area.svg){alt='A diagram showing how "git add" registers changes in the staging area, while "git commit" moves changes from the staging area to the repository'}

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor to the staging area and into long-term storage. First, we'll improve our recipe by changing 'lemon' to 'lime':

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

``` bash
git diff
```

```output
diff --git a/guacamole.md b/guacamole.md

--- a/guacamole.md
+++ b/guacamole.md
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@

```

So far, so good: we've replaced one line (shown with a `-` in the first column) with a new line (shown with a `+` in the first column). Now let's put that change in the staging area and see what `git diff` reports:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git diff
```

There is no output: as far as Git can tell, there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently and what's currently in the directory. However, if we do this:

``` bash
git diff --staged
```

```

::: {.callout-note title="Word-based diffing"}
Sometimes, e.g. in the case of text documents a line-wise diff is too coarse. That is where the `--color-words` option of `git diff` comes in very useful as it highlights the changed words using colors.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Paging the Log"}
When the output of `git log` is too long to fit in your screen, `git` uses a program to split it into pages of the size of your screen. When this "pager" is called, you will notice that the last line in your screen is a `:`, instead of your usual prompt.

- To get out of the pager, press Q.
- To move to the next page, press Spacebar.
- To search for `some_word` in all pages, press `/` and type `some_word`. Navigate through matches pressing N.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Limit Log Size"}
To avoid having `git log` cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the number of commits that Git lists by using `-N`, where `N` is the number of commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from the last commit you can use:

``` bash
git log -1
```

```output
commit 005937fbe2a98fb83f0ade869025dc2636b4dad5 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Alfredo Linguini <a.linguini@ratatouille.fr>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 10:14:07 2013 -0400

   Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
```

You can also reduce the quantity of information using the `--oneline` option:

``` bash
git log --oneline
```

```output
005937f (HEAD -> main) Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
34961b1 Add ingredients for basic guacamole
f22b25e Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```

You can also combine the `--oneline` option with others. One useful combination adds `--graph` to display the commit history as a text-based graph and to indicate which commits are associated with the current `HEAD`, the current branch `main`, or other Git references:

``` bash
git log --oneline --graph
```

```output
* 005937f (HEAD -> main) Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
* 34961b1 Add ingredients for basic guacamole
* f22b25e Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Directories"}
Two important facts you should know about directories in Git.

1. Git does not track directories on their own, only files within them. Try it for yourself:

``` bash
mkdir cakes
git status
git add cakes
git status
```

Note, our newly created empty directory `cakes` does not appear in the list of untracked files even if we explicitly add it (via `git add`) to our repository. This is the reason why you will sometimes see `.gitkeep` files in otherwise empty directories. The sole purpose of `.gitkeep` files is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to the repository. The name `.gitkeep` is just a convention, and in fact, you can name these files anything you like.

2. If you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files, you can add all the files in the directory at once by referring to the directory in your `git add` command. Try it for yourself:

``` bash
touch cakes/brownie cakes/lemon_drizzle
git status
git add cakes
git status
```

Before moving on, we will commit these changes.

``` bash
git commit -m "Add some initial cakes"
```
:::

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository, we first need to add the changed files to the staging area (`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the repository (`git commit`):

![](images/03_version-control__git-committing.svg){alt='A diagram showing two documents being separately staged using git add, before being combined into one commit using git commit'}

## Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the last commit made to `guacamole.md`?

1. "Changes"
2. "Change lemon for lime"
3. "Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe"

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear; and answer 2 is redundant to using "git diff" to see what changed in this commit; but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.
:::

## Committing Changes to Git

Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt` to my local Git repository?

1. `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
2. `git init myfile.txt` then `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
3. `git add myfile.txt` then `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
4. `git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"`

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
2. Would try to create a new repository.
3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.
:::

## Committing Multiple Files

When you make changes, they often belong together as one logical improvement. Git lets you group related edits into a single commit so your project stays consistent. This is something word processors can't easily do—each suggestion is separate, even if they depend on each other.

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1. Add some text to `guacamole.md` noting the rough price of the ingredients.
2. Create a new file `groceries.md` with a list of products and their prices for different markets.
3. Add changes from both files to the staging area, and commit those changes.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
First we make our changes to the `guacamole.md` and `groceries.md` files:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado (1.35)
* lime (0.64)
* salt (2)
```

``` bash
cat groceries.md
```

```output
# Market A
* avocado: 1.35 per unit.
* lime: 0.64 per unit
* salt: 2 per kg
```

Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md groceries.md
```

Or with multiple commands:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git add groceries.md
```

Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:

``` bash
git commit -m "Write prices for ingredients and their source"
```

```output
[main cc127c2]
 Write prices for ingredients and their source
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 groceries.md
```
:::

## `bio` Repository

- Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
- Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt`, commit your changes
- Modify one line, add a fourth line
- Display the differences between its updated state and its original state.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If needed, move out of the `recipes` folder:

``` bash
cd ..
```

Create a new folder called `bio` and 'move' into it:

``` bash
mkdir bio
cd bio
```

Initialise git:

``` bash
git init
```

Create your biography file `me.txt` using VS Code or another text editor. Once in place, add and commit it to the repository:

``` bash
git add me.txt
git commit -m "Add biography file"
```

Modify the file as described (modify one line, add a fourth line). To display the differences between its updated state and its original state, use `git diff`:

``` bash
git diff me.txt
```
:::

# Exploring History

As we saw in the previous episode, we can refer to commits by their identifiers. You can refer to the *most recent commit* of the working directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding small changes at a time to `guacamole.md`, so it's easy to track our progress by looking at it. Let's do that using our `HEAD`. Before we start, let's make a change to `guacamole.md`, adding yet another line.

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
An ill-considered change
```

Now, let's see what we get.

``` bash
git diff HEAD guacamole.md
```

```output
diff --git a/guacamole.md b/guacamole.md

```

Note that `HEAD` is the default option for `git diff`, so omitting it will not change the command's output at all (give it a try). However, the real power of `git diff` lies in its ability to compare with previous commits. For example, by adding `~1` (where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**\-d*uh*]), we can look at the commit before `HEAD`.

``` bash
git diff HEAD~1 guacamole.md
```

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff` again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

``` bash
git diff HEAD~2 guacamole.md
```

```output

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the commit message, rather than the *differences* between a commit and our working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

``` bash
git show HEAD~2 guacamole.md
```

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits. The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`; we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation, so `HEAD~1` means "the previous commit", while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters that both `git log` and `git show` display. These are unique IDs for the changes, and "unique" really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID `f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`, so let's try this:

``` bash
git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b guacamole.md

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we've changed. Now, how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to `guacamole.md` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been staged:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were by using `git restore`:

``` bash
git restore guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

As you might guess from its name, `git restore` restores an old version of a file. By default, it recovers the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`, which is the last saved commit. If we want to go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead, using `-s` option:

``` bash
git restore -s f22b25e guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
## Instructions
```

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Notice that the changes are not currently in the staging area, and have not been committed. If we wished, we can put things back the way they were at the last commit by using `git restore` to overwrite the working copy with the last committed version:

``` bash
git restore guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

It's important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository *before* the change we're trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard. In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`. We use the `.` to mean all files:

![](images/03_version-control__git-restore.svg){alt='A diagram showing how git restore can be used to restore the previous version of two files'}

So, to put it all together, here's how Git works in cartoon form:

![](images/03_version-control__git_staging.svg){alt='A diagram showing the entire git workflow: local changes are staged using git add, applied to the local repository using git commit, and can be restored from the repository using git restore'}

The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

## Recovering Older Versions of a File

Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning "broke" the script and it no longer runs. She has spent approximately 1 hour trying to fix it, with no luck...

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! Which commands below will let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called `data_cruncher.py`?

1. `git restore`
2. `git restore data_cruncher.py`
3. `git restore -s HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`
4. `git restore -s <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`
5. Both 2 and 4

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The answer is (5) - Both 2 and 4.

The `restore` command restores files from the repository, overwriting the files in your working directory. Answers 2 and 4 both restore the *latest* version *in the repository* of the file `data_cruncher.py`. Answer 2 uses `HEAD` to indicate the *latest*, whereas answer 4 uses the unique ID of the last commit, which is what `HEAD` means.

Answer 3 gets the version of `data_cruncher.py` from the commit *before* `HEAD`, which is NOT what we wanted.

Answer 1 results in an error. You need to specify a file to restore. If you want to restore all files you should use `git restore .`
:::

## Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating with colleagues on her Python script. She realizes her last commit to the project's repository contained an error, and wants to undo it. Jennifer wants to undo correctly so everyone in the project's repository gets the correct change. The command `git revert [erroneous commit ID]` will create a new commit that reverses the erroneous commit.

The command `git revert` is different from `git restore -s [commit ID] .` because `git restore` returns the files not yet committed within the local repository to a previous state, whereas `git revert` reverses changes committed to the local and project repositories.

Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use `git revert`. What is the missing command?

1. `________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID`
2. Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).
3. `git revert [commit ID]`
4. Type in the new commit message.
5. Save and close.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The command `git log` lists project history with commit IDs.

The command `git show HEAD` shows changes made at the latest commit, and lists the commit ID; however, Jennifer should double-check it is the correct commit, and no one else has committed changes to the repository.
:::

## Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in the following sequence?

``` bash
cd recipes
echo "I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup" > ketchup.md
git add ketchup.md
echo "ketchup enhances pasta dishes" >> ketchup.md
git commit -m "My opinions about the red sauce"
git restore ketchup.md
cat ketchup.md
```

1. ```output
   ketchup enhances pasta dishes
   ```

2. ```output
   I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup
   ```

3. ```output
   I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup
   ketchup enhances pasta dishes
   ```

4. ```output
   Error because you have changed ketchup.md without committing the changes
   ```

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The answer is 2.

The changes to the file from the second `echo` command are only applied to the working copy, not the version in the staging area. The command `git add ketchup.md` places the current version of `ketchup.md` into the staging area.

So, when `git commit -m "My opinions about the red sauce"` is executed, the version of `ketchup.md` committed to the repository is the one from the staging area and has only one line.

At this time, the working copy still has the second line (and `git status` will show that the file is modified). However, `git restore ketchup.md` replaces the working copy with the most recently committed version of `ketchup.md`. So, `cat ketchup.md` will output:

```output
I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup
```
:::

## Checking Understanding of `git diff`

Consider this command: `git diff HEAD~9 guacamole.md`. What do you predict this command will do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?

Try another command, `git diff [ID] guacamole.md`, where [ID] is replaced with the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen, and what does happen?

## Getting Rid of Staged Changes

`git restore` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed? Make a change to `guacamole.md`, add that change using `git add`, then use `git restore` to see if you can remove your change.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
After adding a change, `git restore` cannot be used directly. Let's look at the output of `git status`:

```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   guacamole.md
```

Note that if you don't have the same output, you may either have forgotten to change the file, or you have added it *and* committed it.

Using the command `git restore guacamole.md` now does not give an error, but it does not restore the file either. Git helpfully tells us that we need to use `git restore --staged` first to unstage the file:

``` bash
git restore --staged guacamole.md
```

Now, `git status` gives us:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This means we can now use `git restore` to restore the file to the previous commit:

``` bash
git restore guacamole.md
git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
:::

## Explore and Summarize Histories

Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a challenge to find the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.

Imagine the `recipes` project has more than 50 files. You would like to find a commit that modifies some specific text in `guacamole.md`. When you type `git log`, a very long list appeared. How can you narrow down the search?

Recall that the `git diff` command allows us to explore one specific file, e.g., `git diff guacamole.md`. We can apply a similar idea here.

``` bash
git log guacamole.md
```

Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g., `update files`. How can you search through these files?

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize a different part of the history for you. Is it possible to combine both? Let's try the following:

``` bash
git log --patch guacamole.md
```

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

``` bash
git log --patch HEAD~9 *.md
```

# Ignoring Things

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Let's create a few dummy files:

``` bash
mkdir pictures
touch a.png b.png c.png pictures/cake1.jpg pictures/cake2.jpg
```

and see what Git says:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.png
	b.png
	c.png
	pictures/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What's worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

``` bash
code .gitignore
```

Type the text below into the `.gitignore` file:

```output
*.png
pictures/
```

Save the file and exit your editor.

Verify that the file contains the files to ignore.

``` bash
cat .gitignore
```

```output
*.png
pictures/
```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.png` and everything in the `pictures` directory. (If any of these files were already being tracked, Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file, the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file. You might think we wouldn't want to track it, but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore the same things that we're ignoring. Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

``` bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore png files and the pictures folder."
git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding files to the repository that we don't want to track:

``` bash
git add a.png
```

```output
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.png
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

If we really want to override our ignore settings, we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example, `git add -f a.png`. We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

``` bash
git status --ignored
```

```output
On branch main
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        a.png
        b.png
        c.png
        pictures/

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Ignoring Nested Files

Given a directory structure that looks like:

``` bash
pictures/cake
pictures/pizza
```

How would you ignore only `pictures/cake` and not `pictures/pizza`?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If you only want to ignore the contents of `pictures/cake`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore only the `/cake/` subfolder by adding the following line to your `.gitignore`:

```output
pictures/cake/
```

This line will ensure only the contents of `pictures/cake` is ignored, and not the contents of `pictures/pizza`.

As with most programming issues, there are a few alternative ways that one may ensure this ignore rule is followed. Further, the discussion pages have more detail on ignore rules.
:::

## Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.png` files in your root directory except for `final.png`?

Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
You would add the following two lines to your `.gitignore`:

```output
*.png           # ignore all png files
!final.png      # except final.png
```

The exclamation point operator will include a previously excluded entry.

Note also that, if you've previously committed `.png` files in this lesson, they will not be ignored with this new rule. Only future additions of `.png` files to the root directory will be ignored.
:::

## Ignoring Nested Files: Variation

Given a directory structure that looks similar to the earlier Nested Files exercise, but with a slightly different directory structure:

``` bash
pictures/cake
pictures/pizza
pictures/pie
pictures/brownie
```

How would you ignore all of the contents in the pictures folder, but not `pictures/pie`?

Hint: think a bit about how you created an exception with the `!` operator before.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If you want to ignore the contents of `pictures/` but not those of `pictures/pie/`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore the contents of pictures folder, but create an exception for the contents of the `pictures/pie` subfolder. Your `.gitignore` would look like this:

```output
pictures/*              # ignore everything in pictures folder
!pictures/pie/          # do not ignore pictures/pie/ contents
```
:::

## Ignoring all data Files in a Directory

Assuming you have an empty `.gitignore` file, and given a directory structure that looks like:

``` bash
pictures/data/location/gps/a.dat
pictures/data/location/gps/b.dat
pictures/data/location/gps/c.dat
pictures/data/location/gps/info.txt
pictures/plots
```

What's the shortest `.gitignore` rule you could write to ignore all `.dat` files in `pictures/data/location/gps`? Do not ignore the `info.txt`.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Appending `pictures/data/location/gps/*.dat` will match every file in `pictures/data/location/gps` that ends with `.dat`. The file `pictures/data/location/gps/info.txt` will not be ignored.
:::

## Ignoring all data Files in the repository

Let us assume you have many `.csv` files in different subdirectories of your repository. For example, you might have:

``` bash
results/a.csv
data/experiment_1/b.csv
data/experiment_2/c.csv
data/experiment_2/variation_1/d.csv
```

How do you ignore all the `.csv` files, without explicitly listing the names of the corresponding folders?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
In the `.gitignore` file, write:

```output
**/*.csv
```

This will ignore all the `.csv` files, regardless of their position in the directory tree. You can still include some specific exception with the exclamation point operator.
:::

## The Order of Rules

Given a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

```output
*.csv
!*.csv
```

What will be the result?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The `!` modifier will negate an entry from a previously defined ignore pattern. Because the `!*.csv` entry negates all of the previous `.csv` files in the `.gitignore`, none of them will be ignored, and all `.csv` files will be tracked.
:::

## Log Files

You wrote a script that creates many intermediate log-files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, `log_03`, etc. You want to keep them but you do not want to track them through `git`.

1. Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.
2. Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form `log_01`, etc.
3. You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.
4. Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude via `.gitignore`.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
1. Append either `log_*` or `log*` as a new entry in your `.gitignore`
2. Track `log_01` using `git add -f log_01`

# Remotes in GitHub

Version control really comes into its own when we begin to collaborate with other people. We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.

Systems like Git allow us to move work between any two repositories. In practice, though, it's easiest to use one copy as a central hub, and to keep it on the web rather than on someone's laptop. Most programmers use hosting services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org), or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) to hold those main copies.

Let's start by sharing the changes we've made to our current project with the world. To this end we are going to create a *remote* repository that will be linked to our *local* repository.

## Creating a remote repository

Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com), then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a new repository called `recipes`.

Name your repository "recipes" and then click "Create Repository".

::: {.callout-note title="Important"}
Since this repository will be connected to a local repository, it needs to be empty. Leave "Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked, and keep "None" as options for both "Add .gitignore" and "Add a license."
:::

As soon as the repository is created, GitHub displays a page with a URL and some information on how to configure your local repository. This effectively does the following on GitHub's servers:

``` bash
mkdir recipes
cd recipes
git init
```

If you remember back to the earlier episode where we added and committed our work on `guacamole.md`, we had a diagram of the local repository. Now that we have two repositories, we need to connect them.

## Connecting local to remote repository

Now we connect the two repositories. We do this by making the GitHub repository a remote for the local repository. The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the URL string we need to identify it. Click on the 'SSH' link to change the protocol from HTTPS to SSH.

::: {.callout-note title="HTTPS vs. SSH"}
We use SSH here because, while it requires some additional configuration, it is a security protocol widely used by many applications. This section describes SSH at a minimum level for GitHub.
:::

Copy that URL from the browser, go into the local `recipes` repository, and run this command:

``` bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:alflin/recipes.git
```

Make sure to use the URL for your repository rather than Alfredo's: the only difference should be your username instead of `alflin`.

`origin` is a local name used to refer to the remote repository. It could be called anything, but `origin` is a convention that is often used by default in git and GitHub, so it's helpful to stick with this unless there's a reason not to.

We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`:

``` bash
git remote -v
```

```output
origin   git@github.com:alflin/recipes.git (fetch)
origin   git@github.com:alflin/recipes.git (push)
```

## SSH Background and Setup

Before Alfredo can connect to a remote repository, he needs to set up a way for his computer to authenticate with GitHub so it knows it's him trying to connect to his remote repository.

We are going to set up the method that is commonly used by many different services to authenticate access on the command line. This method is called Secure Shell Protocol (SSH). SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between computers using an otherwise insecure network.

SSH uses what is called a key pair. This is two keys that work together to validate access. One key is publicly known and called the public key, and the other key called the private key is kept private. You can think of the public key as a padlock, and only you have the key (the private key) to open it. You use the public key where you want a secure method of communication, such as your GitHub account. You give this padlock, or public key, to GitHub and say "lock the communications to my account with this so that only computers that have my private key can unlock communications and send git commands as my GitHub account."

What we will do now is the minimum required to set up the SSH keys and add the public key to a GitHub account.

The first thing we are going to do is check if this has already been done on the computer you're on. Because generally speaking, this setup only needs to happen once and then you can forget about it.

::: {.callout-note title="Keeping your keys secure"}
You shouldn't really forget about your SSH keys, since they keep your account secure. It's good practice to check your SSH keys every so often to ensure they are still secure, up to date, and that there are no unauthorized keys that could compromise your account. This is especially important if you are using multiple computers to access your account.
:::

We will run the list command to check what key pairs already exist on your computer.

``` bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

Your output is going to look a little different depending on whether or not SSH has ever been set up on the computer you are using.

If SSH has not been set up, your output is:

```output
ls: cannot access '~/.ssh': No such file or directory
```

If SSH has been set up on the computer you're using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. The file names are either `id_ed25519`/`id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa`/`id_rsa.pub` depending on how the key pairs were set up.

## Creating an SSH key pair

To create an SSH key pair use this command, where the `-t` option specifies which type of algorithm to use and `-C` attaches a comment to the key (here, your email):

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "a.linguini@ratatouille.fr"
```

If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

``` bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

```output
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/Alfredo/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

We want to use the default file, so just press Enter.

```output
Created directory '/c/Users/Alfredo/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
```

Now, it is prompting you for a passphrase. Since you might be using a shared laptop, you want to create a passphrase. Be sure to use something memorable or save your passphrase somewhere, as there is no "reset my password" option. Note that when typing a passphrase on a terminal, there won't be any visual feedback of your typing. This is normal: your passphrase will be recorded even if you see nothing changing on your screen.

```output
Enter same passphrase again:
```

After entering the same passphrase a second time, you receive the confirmation:

```output
Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/Alfredo/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/Alfredo/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:SMSPIStNyA00KPxuYu94KpZgRAYjgt9g4BA4kFy3g1o a.linguini@ratatouille.fr
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|^B== o.          |
|%*=.*.+          |
|+=.E =.+         |
| .=.+.o..        |
|....  . S        |
|.+ o             |
|+ =              |
|.o.o             |
|oo+.             |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The "identification" is actually the private key. You should never share it. The public key is appropriately named. The "key fingerprint" is a shorter version of a public key.

Now that you have generated the SSH keys, you will find the SSH files when you check:

``` bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

```output
drwxr-xr-x 1 Alfredo   197121   0 Jul 16 14:48 ./
drwxr-xr-x 1 Alfredo   197121   0 Jul 16 14:48 ../
-rw-r--r-- 1 Alfredo   197121 419 Jul 16 14:48 id_ed25519
-rw-r--r-- 1 Alfredo   197121 106 Jul 16 14:48 id_ed25519.pub
```

::: {.callout-note title="Resolving SSH Key Conflicts" collapse="true"}
If you need to create an SSH key pair with a custom name or store it in a non-default location (e.g., because a default-named key like id_ed25519 already exists), Git may not automatically use it when pushing or pulling from GitHub.

One solution is to add a GitHub entry to your SSH config. Open or create the SSH config file:

``` bash
code ~/.ssh/config
```

Add an entry for GitHub, replacing the path with your key's actual name and location:

```output
Host github.com
	HostName github.com
	User git
	IdentityFile ~/<full_path_to_SSH_key_file>/<key_name>
	IdentitiesOnly yes
```

Save and exit. Now Git will use the correct key when pushing to GitHub.
:::

## Copying the public key to GitHub

Now you have an SSH key pair and you can run this command to check if GitHub can read your authentication:

``` bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

```output
The authenticity of host 'github.com (192.30.255.112)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey).
```

Right, we forgot that we need to give GitHub our public key!

First, we need to copy the public key. Be sure to include the `.pub` at the end, otherwise you're looking at the private key.

``` bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

```output
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIDmRA3d51X0uu9wXek559gfn6UFNF69yZjChyBIU2qKI a.linguini@ratatouille.fr
```

Now, going to GitHub.com, click on your profile icon in the top right corner to get the drop-down menu. Click "Settings", then on the settings page, click "SSH and GPG keys" on the left side "Access" menu. Click the "New SSH key" button on the right side. Now, you can add the title (use something descriptive like "My Laptop" so you can remember where the original key pair files are located), paste your SSH key into the field, and click the "Add SSH key" to complete the setup.

Now that you've set that up, let's check your authentication again from the command line:

``` bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

```output
Hi Alfredo! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Good! This output confirms that the SSH key works as intended. You are now ready to push your work to the remote repository.

## Pushing local changes to a remote

Now that authentication is set up, we can return to the remote. This command will push the changes from our local repository to the repository on GitHub:

``` bash
git push origin main
```

If you set up a passphrase, it will prompt you for it. If you completed advanced settings for your authentication, it will not prompt for a passphrase.

```output

Counting objects: 100% (16/16), done.

 * [new branch]      main -> main
```

::: {.callout-note title="Proxy"}
If the network you are connected to uses a proxy, there is a chance that your last command failed with "Could not resolve hostname" as the error message. To solve this issue, you need to tell Git about the proxy:

``` bash
git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@proxy.url
git config --global https.proxy https://user:password@proxy.url
```

When you connect to another network that doesn't use a proxy, you will need to tell Git to disable the proxy using:

``` bash
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Password Managers"}
If your operating system has a password manager configured, `git push` will try to use it when it needs your username and password. For example, this is the default behavior for Git Bash on Windows. If you want to type your username and password at the terminal instead of using a password manager, type:

``` bash
unset SSH_ASKPASS
```

in the terminal, before you run `git push`. Despite the name, Git uses `SSH_ASKPASS` for all credential entry, so you may want to unset `SSH_ASKPASS` whether you are using Git via SSH or HTTPS.

You may also want to add `unset SSH_ASKPASS` at the end of your `~/.bashrc` to make Git default to using the terminal for usernames and passwords.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="The '-u' Flag"}
You may see a `-u` option used with `git push` in some documentation. This option is synonymous with the `--set-upstream-to` option for the `git branch` command, and is used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so that the `git pull` command can be used without any arguments. To do this, simply use `git push -u origin main` once the remote has been set up.
:::

We can pull changes from the remote repository to the local one as well:

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

```output
From https://github.com/alflin/recipes
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up to date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case because the two repositories are already synchronized. If someone else had pushed some changes to the repository on GitHub, though, this command would download them to our local repository.

## GitHub GUI

Browse to your `recipes` repository on GitHub. Under the Code tab, find and click on the text that says "XX commits" (where "XX" is some number). Hover over, and click on, the three buttons to the right of each commit. What information can you gather/explore from these buttons? How would you get that same information in the shell?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
When you click on the left-most button, you'll see all of the changes that were made in that particular commit. Green shaded lines indicate additions and red ones removals. In the shell we can do the same thing with `git diff`. In particular, `git diff ID1..ID2` where ID1 and ID2 are commit identifiers (e.g. `git diff a3bf1e5..041e637`) will show the differences between those two commits.

The middle button (with the picture of two overlapping squares or pages) copies the full identifier of the commit to the clipboard. In the shell, `git log` will show you the full commit identifier for each commit.

The right-most button lets you view all of the files in the repository at the time of that commit. To do this in the shell, we'd need to checkout the repository at that particular time. We can do this with `git checkout ID` where ID is the identifier of the commit we want to look at. If we do this, we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterwards!
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Uploading files directly in GitHub browser"}
GitHub also allows you to skip the command line and upload files directly to your repository without having to leave the browser. There are two options. First you can click the "Upload files" button in the toolbar at the top of the file tree. Or, you can drag and drop files from your desktop onto the file tree. You can read more about this on the [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/).
:::

## GitHub Timestamp

Create a remote repository on GitHub. Push the contents of your local repository to the remote. Make changes to your local repository and push these changes. Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the timestamps of the files. How does GitHub record times, and why?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
GitHub displays timestamps in a human readable relative format (i.e. "22 hours ago" or "three weeks ago"). However, if you hover over the timestamp, you can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred.
:::

## Push vs. Commit

In this episode, we introduced the `git push` command. How is `git push` different from `git commit`?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
When we push changes, we're interacting with a remote repository to update it with the changes we've made locally (often this corresponds to sharing the changes we've made with others). Commit only updates your local repository.
:::

## GitHub License and README files

In this episode we learned about creating a remote repository on GitHub, but when you initialized your GitHub repo, you didn't add a README.md or a license file. If you had, what do you think would have happened when you tried to link your local and remote repositories?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
In this case, you'd see a merge conflict due to unrelated histories. When GitHub creates a README.md file, it performs a commit in the remote repository. When you try to pull the remote repository to your local repository, Git detects that they have histories that do not share a common origin and refuses to merge.

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

```output
warning: no common commits
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.

 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      main     -> origin/main
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

You can force git to merge the two repositories with the option `--allow-unrelated-histories`. Be careful when you use this option and carefully examine the contents of local and remote repositories before merging.

``` bash
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories origin main
```

```output
From https://github.com/alflin/recipes
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD

# Collaborating

Version control really shines when we collaborate with other people. We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; now we'll see how to use it effectively.

::: {.callout-note title="Practicing By Yourself"}
If you're working through this lesson on your own, you can carry on by opening a second terminal window. This window will represent your partner, working on another computer. You won't need to give anyone access on GitHub, because both 'partners' are you.
:::

## Adding collaborators

The repository owner needs to give other people access. In your repository page on GitHub, click the "Settings" button on the right, select "Collaborators", click "Add people", and then enter your collaborator's username.

To accept access to the owner's repository, the collaborator needs to go to [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications) or check for email notification. Once there, they can accept access to the owner's repository.

## Cloning a repository

Next, the collaborator needs to download a copy of the owner's repository to their machine. This is called "cloning a repo".

The collaborator doesn't want to overwrite their own version of `recipes.git`, so they need to clone the owner's repository to a different location than their own repository with the same name.

To clone the owner's repo into the home directory `~`, the collaborator enters:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:alflin/recipes.git ~/alflin-recipes
```

Replace 'alflin' with the owner's username.

::: {.callout-note title="Important"}
If you choose to clone without the clone path (`~/alflin-recipes`) specified at the end, you will clone inside your own recipes folder! Make sure to navigate to the home directory first.
:::

## Making changes as a collaborator

The collaborator can now make a change in their clone of the owner's repository, exactly the same way as we've been doing before:

``` bash
cd ~/alflin-recipes
code hummus.md
cat hummus.md
```

```output
# Hummus
## Ingredients
* chickpeas
* lemon
* olive oil
* salt
```

``` bash
git add hummus.md
git commit -m "Add ingredients for hummus"
```

```output
 1 file changed, 6 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hummus.md
```

Then push the change to the *owner's repository* on GitHub:

``` bash
git push origin main
```

```output
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 4, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 306 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git
   9272da5..29aba7c  main -> main
```

Note that we didn't have to create a remote called `origin`: Git uses this name by default when we clone a repository. (This is why `origin` was a sensible choice earlier when we were setting up remotes by hand.)

Take a look at the owner's repository on GitHub again, and you should be able to see the new commit made by the collaborator. You may need to refresh your browser to see the new commit.

## Understanding remotes

In this episode and the previous one, our local repository has had a single "remote", called `origin`. A remote is a copy of the repository that is hosted somewhere else, that we can push to and pull from, and there's no reason that you have to work with only one. For example, on some large projects you might have your own copy in your own GitHub account (you'd probably call this `origin`) and also the main "upstream" project repository (let's call this `upstream` for the sake of examples). You would pull from `upstream` from time to time to get the latest updates that other people have committed.

Remember that the name you give to a remote only exists locally. It's an alias that you choose - whether `origin`, or `upstream`, or `alfred` - and not something intrinsic to the remote repository.

The `git remote` family of commands is used to set up and alter the remotes associated with a repository. Here are some of the most useful ones:

- `git remote -v` lists all the remotes that are configured (we already used this in the last episode)
- `git remote add [name] [url]` is used to add a new remote
- `git remote remove [name]` removes a remote. Note that it doesn't affect the remote repository at all - it just removes the link to it from the local repo.
- `git remote set-url [name] [newurl]` changes the URL that is associated with the remote. This is useful if it has moved, e.g. to a different GitHub account, or from GitHub to a different hosting service. Or, if we made a typo when adding it!
- `git remote rename [oldname] [newname]` changes the local alias by which a remote is known - its name. For example, one could use this to change `upstream` to `alfred`.

## Pulling changes from a collaborator

To download the collaborator's changes from GitHub, the owner now enters:

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

```output
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 3 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/alflin/recipes
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
   9272da5..29aba7c  main     -> origin/main
Updating 9272da5..29aba7c
Fast-forward
 hummus.md | 5 +
 1 file changed, 5 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hummus.md
```

Now the three repositories (owner's local, collaborator's local, and owner's on GitHub) are back in sync.

::: {.callout-note title="A Basic Collaborative Workflow"}
In practice, it is good to be sure that you have an updated version of the repository you are collaborating on, so you should `git pull` before making changes. The basic collaborative workflow would be:

- update your local repo with `git pull origin main`,
- make your changes and stage them with `git add`,
- commit your changes with `git commit -m`, and
- upload the changes to GitHub with `git push origin main`

It is better to make many commits with smaller changes rather than one commit with massive changes: small commits are easier to read and review.
:::

## Switch Roles and Repeat

Switch roles with your partner and repeat the whole process. One person should now be the collaborator making changes to the other person's repository.

## Review Changes

The owner pushed commits to the repository without giving any information to the collaborator. How can the collaborator find out what has changed with the command line? And on GitHub?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
On the command line, the collaborator can use `git fetch origin main` to get the remote changes into the local repository, but without merging them. Then by running `git diff main origin/main` the collaborator will see the changes output in the terminal.

On GitHub, the collaborator can go to the repository and click on "commits" to view the most recent commits pushed to the repository.
:::

## Comment Changes in GitHub

The collaborator has some questions about one line change made by the owner and has some suggestions to propose.

With GitHub, it is possible to comment on the diff of a commit. Over the line of code to comment, a blue comment icon appears to open a comment window.

The collaborator posts their comments and suggestions using the GitHub interface.

## Version History, Backup, and Version Control

Some backup software can keep a history of the versions of your files. They also allow you to recover specific versions. How is this functionality different from version control? What are some of the benefits of using version control, Git, and GitHub?

# Conflicts

As soon as people can work in parallel, they'll likely step on each other's toes. This will even happen with a single person: if we are working on a piece of software on both our laptop and a server in the lab, we could make different changes to each copy. Version control helps us manage these conflicts by giving us tools to resolve overlapping changes.

To see how we can resolve conflicts, we must first create one. The file `guacamole.md` currently looks like this in both partners' copies of our `recipes` repository:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

Let's add a line to the collaborator's copy only:

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
* put one avocado into a bowl.
```

and then push the change to GitHub:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git commit -m "First step on the instructions"
```

```output
[main 5ae9631] First step on the instructions
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

``` bash
git push origin main
```

```output

Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 331 bytes | 331.00 KiB/s, done.

remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
To https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git
   29aba7c..dabb4c8  main -> main
```

Now let's have the owner make a different change to their copy *without* updating from GitHub:

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
* peel the avocados
```

We can commit the change locally:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git commit -m "Add first step"
```

```output
[main 07ebc69] Add first step
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

but Git won't let us push it to GitHub:

``` bash
git push origin main
```

```output
To https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

Git rejects the push because it detects that the remote repository has new updates that have not been incorporated into the local branch. What we have to do is pull the changes from GitHub, merge them into the copy we're currently working in, and then push that. Let's start by pulling:

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

```output
remote: Enumerating objects: 5, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1/1), done.

Auto-merging guacamole.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in guacamole.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

::: {.callout-note title="You may need to tell Git what to do"}
If you see the below in your output, Git is asking what it should do.

```output
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint:
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge (the default strategy)
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint:
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
```

In newer versions of Git it gives you the option of specifying different behaviors when a pull would merge divergent branches. In our case we want 'the default strategy'. To use this strategy run the following command to select it as the default thing git should do.

``` bash
git config pull.rebase false
```

Then attempt the pull again.

``` bash
git pull origin main
```
:::

The `git pull` command updates the local repository to include those changes already included in the remote repository. After the changes from remote branch have been fetched, Git detects that changes made to the local copy overlap with those made to the remote repository, and therefore refuses to merge the two versions to stop us from trampling on our previous work. The conflict is marked in the affected file:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
<<<<<<< HEAD
* peel the avocados
=======
* put one avocado into a bowl.
>>>>>>> dabb4c8c450e8475aee9b14b4383acc99f42af1d
```

Our change is preceded by `<<<<<<< HEAD`. Git has then inserted `=======` as a separator between the conflicting changes and marked the end of the content downloaded from GitHub with `>>>>>>>`. (The string of letters and digits after that marker identifies the commit we've just downloaded.)

It is now up to us to edit this file to remove these markers and reconcile the changes. We can do anything we want: keep the change made in the local repository, keep the change made in the remote repository, write something new to replace both, or get rid of the change entirely. Let's replace both so that the file looks like this:

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
* peel the avocados and put them into a bowl.
```

To finish merging, we add `guacamole.md` to the changes being made by the merge and then commit:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git status
```

```output
On branch main
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   guacamole.md

```

``` bash
git commit -m "Merge changes from GitHub"
```

```output
[main 2abf2b1] Merge changes from GitHub
```

Now we can push our changes to GitHub:

``` bash
git push origin main
```

```output
Enumerating objects: 10, done.
Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads

remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (4/4), completed with 2 local objects.

   dabb4c8..2abf2b1  main -> main
```

Git keeps track of what we've merged with what, so we don't have to fix things by hand again when the collaborator who made the first change pulls again:

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

```output
remote: Enumerating objects: 10, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

```

We get the merged file:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
* peel the avocados and put them into a bowl.
```

We don't need to merge again because Git knows someone has already done that.

## Strategies to minimize conflicts

Git's ability to resolve conflicts is very useful, but conflict resolution costs time and effort, and can introduce errors if conflicts are not resolved correctly. If you find yourself resolving a lot of conflicts in a project, consider these technical approaches to reducing them:

- Pull from upstream more frequently, especially before starting new work
- Use topic branches to segregate work, merging to main when complete
- Make smaller more atomic commits
- Push your work when it is done and encourage your team to do the same to reduce work in progress and, by extension, the chance of having conflicts
- Where logically appropriate, break large files into smaller ones so that it is less likely that two authors will alter the same file simultaneously

Conflicts can also be minimized with project management strategies:

- Clarify who is responsible for what areas with your collaborators
- Discuss what order tasks should be carried out in with your collaborators so that tasks expected to change the same lines won't be worked on simultaneously
- If the conflicts are stylistic churn (e.g. tabs vs. spaces), establish a project convention that is governing and use code style tools (e.g. `htmltidy`, `perltidy`, `rubocop`, etc.) to enforce, if necessary

## Solving Conflicts that You Create

Clone the repository created by your instructor. Add a new file to it, and modify an existing file (your instructor will tell you which one). When asked by your instructor, pull their changes from the repository to create a conflict, then resolve it.

## Conflicts on Non-textual files

What does Git do when there is a conflict in an image or some other non-textual file that is stored in version control?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Let's try it. Suppose Alfredo takes a picture of their guacamole and calls it `guacamole.jpg`.

If you do not have an image file of guacamole available, you can create a dummy binary file like this:

``` bash
head --bytes 1024 /dev/urandom > guacamole.jpg
ls -lh guacamole.jpg
```

```output
-rw-r--r-- 1 alflin 57095 1.0K Mar  8 20:24 guacamole.jpg
```

`ls` shows us that this created a 1-kilobyte file. It is full of random bytes read from the special file, `/dev/urandom`.

Now, suppose Alfredo adds `guacamole.jpg` to their repository:

``` bash
git add guacamole.jpg
git commit -m "Add picture of guacamole"
```

```output
[main 8e4115c] Add picture of guacamole
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 guacamole.jpg
```

Suppose that Jimmy has added a similar picture in the meantime. Their picture is a picture of guacamole with nachos, but it is *also* called `guacamole.jpg`. When Alfredo tries to push, they get a familiar message:

``` bash
git push origin main
```

```output
To https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

We've learned that we must pull first and resolve any conflicts:

``` bash
git pull origin main
```

When there is a conflict on an image or other binary file, git prints a message like this:

```output
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/alflin/recipes.git
 * branch            main     -> FETCH_HEAD
   6a67967..439dc8c  main     -> origin/main
warning: Cannot merge binary files: guacamole.jpg (HEAD vs. 439dc8c08869c342438f6dc4a2b615b05b93c76e)
Auto-merging guacamole.jpg
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in guacamole.jpg
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

The conflict message here is mostly the same as it was for `guacamole.md`, but there is one key additional line:

```output
warning: Cannot merge binary files: guacamole.jpg (HEAD vs. 439dc8c08869c342438f6dc4a2b615b05b93c76e)
```

Git cannot automatically insert conflict markers into an image as it does for text files. So, instead of editing the image file, we must check out the version we want to keep. Then we can add and commit this version.

On the key line above, Git has conveniently given us commit identifiers for the two versions of `guacamole.jpg`. Our version is `HEAD`, and Jimmy's version is `439dc8c0...`. If we want to use our version, we can use `git checkout`:

``` bash
git checkout HEAD guacamole.jpg
git add guacamole.jpg
git commit -m "Use image of just guacamole instead of with nachos"
```

```output
[main 21032c3] Use image of just guacamole instead of with nachos
```

If instead we want to use Jimmy's version, we can use `git checkout` with Jimmy's commit identifier, `439dc8c0`:

``` bash
git checkout 439dc8c0 guacamole.jpg
git add guacamole.jpg
git commit -m "Use image of guacamole with nachos instead of just guacamole"
```

```output
[main da21b34] Use image of guacamole with nachos instead of just guacamole
```

We can also keep *both* images. The catch is that we cannot keep them under the same name. But, we can check out each version in succession and *rename* it, then add the renamed versions. First, check out each image and rename it:

``` bash
git checkout HEAD guacamole.jpg
git mv guacamole.jpg guacamole-only.jpg
git checkout 439dc8c0 guacamole.jpg
mv guacamole.jpg guacamole-nachos.jpg
```

Then, remove the old `guacamole.jpg` and add the two new files:

``` bash
git rm guacamole.jpg
git add guacamole-only.jpg
git add guacamole-nachos.jpg
git commit -m "Use two images: just guacamole and with nachos"
```

```output
[main 94ae08c] Use two images: just guacamole and with nachos
 2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 guacamole-nachos.jpg
 rename guacamole.jpg => guacamole-only.jpg (100%)
```

Now both images of guacamole are checked into the repository, and `guacamole.jpg` no longer exists.

## A Typical Work Session

You sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is tracked in a remote Git repository. During your work session, you take the following actions, but not in this order:

- *Make changes* by appending the number `100` to a text file `numbers.txt`
- *Update remote* repository to match the local repository
- *Celebrate* your success with some fancy beverage(s)
- *Update local* repository to match the remote repository
- *Stage changes* to be committed
- *Commit changes* to the local repository

In what order should you perform these actions to minimize the chances of conflicts? Put the commands above in order in the *action* column of the table below. When you have the order right, see if you can write the corresponding commands in the *command* column. A few steps are populated to get you started.

| order | action | command |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1     | | |
| 2     | | `echo 100 >> numbers.txt` |
| 3     | | |
| 4     | | |
| 5     | | |
| 6     | Celebrate! | |

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}

# Licensing and Citation

## Licensing

As an open source project, Software Carpentry relies on volunteers to create our lessons and includes a file named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt` file in all public lesson repositories. This file is used to specify that all materials are freely available under the Creative Commons Attribution license. Without a file that clearly states under which license any public source code, manuscript or other creative works is being made available, the default copyright laws apply. To learn more about licensing and open source, you can read more about [Github's description of licenses](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) and the [legal grounds for open source licensing](https://opensource.guide/legal/#are-public-github-projects-open-source).

A license solves this problem by granting rights to others (the licensees) that they would otherwise not have. What rights are being granted under which conditions differs, often only slightly, from one license to another. In practice, a few licenses are by far the most popular, and [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) will help you find a common license that suits your needs. Important considerations include:

- Whether you want to address patent rights.
- Whether you require people distributing derivative works to also distribute their source code.
- Whether the content you are licensing is source code.
- Whether you want to license the code at all.

Choosing a license that is in common use makes life easier for contributors and users, because they are more likely to already be familiar with the license and don't have to wade through a bunch of jargon to decide if they're ok with it. The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) and [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) both maintain lists of licenses which are good choices.

[This article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598) provides an excellent overview of licensing and licensing options from the perspective of scientists who also write code.

At the end of the day what matters is that there is a clear statement as to what the license is. Also, the license is best chosen from the get-go, even if for a repository that is not public. Pushing off the decision only makes it more complicated later, because each time a new collaborator starts contributing, they, too, hold copyright and will thus need to be asked for approval once a license is chosen.

### Can I Use Open License?

Find out whether you are allowed to apply an open license to your software. Can you do this unilaterally, or do you need permission from someone in your institution? If so, who?

### What licenses have I already accepted?

Many of the software tools we use on a daily basis (including in this workshop) are released as open-source software. Pick a project on GitHub from the list below, or one of your own choosing. Find its license (usually in a file called `LICENSE` or `COPYING`) and talk about how it restricts your use of the software. Is it one of the licenses discussed in this session? How is it different?

- [Git](https://github.com/git/git), the source-code management tool
- [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython), the standard implementation of the Python language
- [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter), the project behind the web-based Python notebooks we'll be using
- [EtherPad](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite), a real-time collaborative editor

## Citation

You may want to include a file called `CITATION` or `CITATION.txt` that describes how to reference your project. For example, the [one for Software Carpentry](https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/blob/gh-pages/CITATION) states:

```
To reference Software Carpentry in publications, please cite:

Greg Wilson: "Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned". F1000Research,
2016, 3:62 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.3-62.v2).

@online{wilson-software-carpentry-2016,
  author      = {Greg Wilson},
  title       = {Software Carpentry: Lessons Learned},
  version     = {2},

  url         = {http://f1000research.com/articles/3-62/v2},
  doi         = {10.12688/f1000research.3-62.v2}
}
```

More detailed advice, and other ways to make your code citable can be found [at the Software Sustainability Institute blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/publication/how-cite-and-describe-software) and in:

```
Smith AM, Katz DS, Niemeyer KE, FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group. (2016) Software citation
principles. PeerJ Computer Science 2:e86.
https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86
```

There is also an `@software{...}` [BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) entry type in case no "umbrella" citation like a paper or book exists for the project you want to make citable.

Finally, you may wish to include citation information in a [Citation File Format (`CITATION.cff`)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/). CFF files are standardized human and machine readable citation information files for software and datasets. If you host your repository on GitHub, this information is automatically linked and rendered on the repository page and a BibTeX snippet is provided, which users can copy and paste, making it easy for your project to be cited. Further, integration with both Zenodo and Zotero is supported.

[A chapter of The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/citable/citable-cite#citing-software) provides more detail on how you can use CFF files to make your software citable.

You can use the [cff-init](https://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/) website to easily create and update a `CITATION.cff` file.

# Hosting

After choosing a license, another big question is where to host your code and data.

**University or Lab Servers**: Your institution can provide a server to manage accounts and backups. The main benefit is clarifying who owns what—important for sensitive data or patent applications. Drawbacks include costs and uncertainty about long-term availability.

**Personal Domain and ISP**: You can purchase a domain and use an Internet service provider to host it. This gives more control but requires more setup time and effort.

**Public Hosting Services**: Services like [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) offer web interfaces for creating and editing repositories. They also provide:
- Issue tracking and wiki pages
- Email notifications and code reviews
- Economies of scale—easier to run one large service well
- Network effects—easier collaboration with communities using the same service

GitHub repositories can be assigned DOIs by [connecting releases to Zenodo](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/). For example, [`10.5281/zenodo.7908089`](https://zenodo.org/record/7908089) is a DOI for this introduction to Git.

Large hosting services also enable **continuous integration (CI)**, which automatically runs software builds and tests when code is committed or pull requests are submitted. CI is free for open source projects.

::: {.callout-note title="Institutional Barriers"}
Sharing is ideal for science, but institutions may restrict sharing to protect intellectual property or sensitive data. If you encounter restrictions, inquire about the motivations and request exceptions or push for institutional reform to support open science.
:::

### Can My Work Be Public?

Find out whether you're allowed to host your work openly in a public repository. Do you need permission from your institution?

### Where Can I Share My Work?

Does your institution have repositories for sharing papers, data, and software? How do institutional repositories differ from services like [arXiV](https://arxiv.org/), [figshare](https://figshare.com/), [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)?
