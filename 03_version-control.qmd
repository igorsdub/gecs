The biggest concern that every reseracher using software faces is to rememer how to run a program, fix broken parts wihout affecting the working ones, and experiment by adding new features. Version control can do that! Although, the learning curve is steep your future self will think: "How no one has taught me this before?!"

Jimmy and Alfredo have been hired by Ratatouille restaurant to investigate if it is possible to make the best recipes archive ever. They want to be able to work on indexing the prices at the same time, but they have run into problems doing this in the past. If they take turns, each one will spend a lot of time waiting for the other to finish, but if they work on their own copies and email changes back and forth things will be lost, overwritten, or duplicated.

Version control is better than mailing files back and forth:

-   Nothing that is committed to version control is ever lost, unless you work really, really hard at losing it. Since all old versions of files are saved, it's always possible to go back in time to see exactly who wrote what on a particular day, or what version of a program was used to generate a particular set of results.

-   As we have this record of who made what changes when, we know who to ask if we have questions later on, and, if needed, revert to a previous version, much like the "undo" feature in an editor.

-   When several people collaborate in the same project, it's possible to accidentally overlook or overwrite someone's changes. The version control system automatically notifies users whenever there's a conflict between one person's work and another's.

Teams are not the only ones to benefit from version control: lone researchers can benefit immensely. Keeping a record of what was changed, when, and why is extremely useful for all researchers if they ever need to come back to the project later on (e.g., a year later, when memory has faded).

**Version control is the lab notebook of the digital world**: it's what professionals use to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Every large software development project relies on it, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well. And it isn't just for software: books, papers, small data sets, and anything that changes over time or needs to be shared can and should be stored in a version control system.

## Installing Git

You should have Git already installed in your distribution. Check it out by typing in your terminal:

``` bash
git --version
```

If you get an error, please see [this webpage](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#git) from The Software Carpentries for instructions on installing Git for various operating systems.

## Creating GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, check the [Setting Up](00_setting-up.qmd) section.

## Preparing Your Working Directory

You can choose which directory you want to work in. If you have no preference, move to your home directory:

``` bash
cd
```

# Automated Version Control

We'll start by exploring how version control can be used to keep track of what one person did and when. Even if you aren't collaborating with other people, automated version control is much better than this situation:

![Comic: a PhD student sends "FINAL.doc" to their supervisor, but after several increasingly intense and frustrating rounds of comments and revisions they end up with a file named "FINAL_rev.22.comments49.corrections.10.#\@\$%WHYDIDCOMETOGRADSCHOOL????.doc"](images/03_version-control__phd101212s.png)

We've all been in this situation before: it seems unnecessary to have multiple nearly-identical versions of the same document. Some word processors let us deal with this a little better, such as Microsoft Word's [Track Changes](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Track-changes-in-Word-197ba630-0f5f-4a8e-9a77-3712475e806a), Google Docs' [version history](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843?hl=en), or LibreOffice's [Recording and Displaying Changes](https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/Recording_and_Displaying_Changes).

Version control systems start with a base version of the document and then record changes you make each step of the way. You can think of it as a recording of your progress: you can rewind to start at the base document and play back each change you made, eventually arriving at your more recent version.

![](images/03_version-control__play-changes.svg){alt="A diagram demonstrating how a single document grows as the result of sequential changes"}

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then think about "playing back" different sets of changes on the base document, ultimately resulting in different versions of that document. For example, two users can make independent sets of changes on the same document.

![](images/03_version-control__versions.svg){alt="A diagram with one source document that has been modified in two different ways to produce two different versions of the document"}

Unless multiple users make changes to the same section of the document - a conflict - you can incorporate two sets of changes into the same base document.

![](images/03_version-control__merge.svg){alt="A diagram that shows the merging of two different document versions into one document that contains all of the changes from both versions"}

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us, effectively creating different versions of our files. It allows us to decide which changes will be made to the next version (each record of these changes is called a commit), and keeps useful metadata about them, such as who made the change. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository. Repositories can be kept in sync across different computers, facilitating collaboration among different people.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="minimal" title="The Long History of Version Control Systems"}
Automated version control systems are nothing new. Tools like [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System), [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), or [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) have been around since the early 1980s and are used by many large companies. However, many of these are now considered legacy systems (i.e., outdated) due to various limitations in their capabilities. More modern systems, such as [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial), are *distributed*, meaning that they do not need a centralized server to host the repository. These modern systems also include powerful merging tools that make it possible for multiple authors to work on the same files concurrently.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as an alternative to BitKeeper, one of the first distributed version control systems, to track changes in the Linux kernel. Torvalds provided several explanations of the name, of varying degrees of politeness, which are enumerated in the [project's README](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/README.md?plain=1#L55), including "Global Information Tacker" for when "you're in a good mood".

For those interested, The Carpentries has a [Version Control with Mercurial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/hg-novice/) lesson (2013-2018), which provides additional context and historical perspective.

# Setting Up Git

When we use Git on a new computer for the first time, we need to configure a few things. Below are a few examples of configurations we will set as we get started with Git:

-   our name and email address,
-   what our preferred text editor is,
-   and that we want to use these settings globally (i.e. for every project).

On a command line, Git commands are written as `git verb options`, where `verb` is what we actually want to do and `options` is additional optional information which may be needed for the `verb`. So here is how Alfredo sets up his new laptop:

``` bash
git config --global user.name "Alfredo Linguini"
git config --global user.email "a.linguini@ratatouille.fr"
```

Please use your own name and email address instead of Alfredo's. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) or another Git host server after this lesson will include this information.

For this lesson, we will be interacting with [GitHub](https://github.com/) and so the email address used should be the same as the one used when setting up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, please review [GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/).

::: {.callout-note title="Keeping your email private"}
If you elect to use a private email address with GitHub, then use GitHub's no-reply email address for the `user.email` value. It looks like `ID+username@users.noreply.github.com`. You can look up your own address in your GitHub [email settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Line Endings"}
As with other keys, when you press Enter on your keyboard, your computer encodes this input as a character. Different operating systems use different character(s) to represent the end of a line. (You may also hear these referred to as newlines or line breaks.) Because Git uses these characters to compare files, it may cause unexpected issues when editing a file on different machines. Though it is beyond the scope of this lesson, you can read more about this issue [in the Pro Git book](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#_core_autocrlf).

You can change the way Git recognizes and encodes line endings using the `core.autocrlf` command to `git config`. The following settings are recommended:

On macOS and Linux:

``` bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

And on Windows:

``` bash
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```
:::

Alfredo also has to set his favorite text editor, following this table:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
It is possible to reconfigure the text editor for Git whenever you want to change it.

::: {.callout-note title="Exiting Vim"}
Note that Vim is the default editor for many programs. If you haven't used Vim before and wish to exit a session without saving your changes, press Esc then type `:q!` and press Enter. If you want to save your changes and quit, press Esc then type `:wq` and press Enter.
:::

Git (2.28+) allows configuration of the name of the branch created when you initialize any new repository. Alfredo decides to use that feature to set it to `main` so it matches the cloud service he will eventually use.

``` bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

::: {.callout-note title="Default Git branch naming"}
Source file changes are associated with a "branch." For new learners in this lesson, it's enough to know that branches exist, and this lesson uses one branch. By default, Git will create a branch called `master` when you create a new repository with `git init` (as explained in the next episode). This term evokes the racist practice of human slavery and the [software development community](https://github.com/github/renaming) has moved to adopt more inclusive language.

In 2020, most Git code hosting services transitioned to using `main` as the default branch. As an example, any new repository that is opened in GitHub and GitLab default to `main`. However, Git has not yet made the same change. As a result, local repositories must be manually configured have the same main branch name as most cloud services.

For versions of Git prior to 2.28, the change can be made on an individual repository level. The command for this is in the next episode. Note that if this value is unset in your local Git configuration, the `init.defaultBranch` value defaults to `master`.
:::

The five commands we just ran above only need to be run once: the flag `--global` tells Git to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.

Let's review those settings and test our `core.editor` right away:

``` bash
git config --global --edit
```

Let's close the file without making any additional changes. Remember, since typos in the config file will cause issues, it's safer to view the configuration with:

``` bash
git config --list --global
```

And if necessary, change your configuration using the same commands to choose another editor or update your email address. This can be done as many times as you want.

::: {.callout-note title="Proxy"}
In some networks you need to use a [proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server). If this is the case, you may also need to tell Git about the proxy:

``` bash
git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
git config --global https.proxy proxy-url
```

To disable the proxy, use

``` bash
git config --global --unset http.proxy
git config --global --unset https.proxy
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Git Help and Manual"}
Always remember that if you forget the subcommands or options of a `git` command, you can access the relevant list of options typing `git <command> -h` or access the corresponding Git manual by typing `git <command> --help`, e.g.:

``` bash
git config -h
git config --help
```

While viewing the manual, remember the `:` is a prompt waiting for commands and you can press Q to exit the manual.

More generally, you can get the list of available `git` commands and further resources of the Git manual typing:

``` bash
git help
```
:::

# Creating a Repository


Once Git is configured, we can start using it.

We will help Alfredo with his new project, create a repository with all his recipes.

First, let's create a new directory in the home directory `~` for our work and then change the current working directory to the newly created one:

``` bash
cd 
mkdir recipes
cd recipes
```

Then we tell Git to make `recipes` a repository -- a place where Git can store versions of our files:

``` bash
git init
```

It is important to note that `git init` will create a repository that can include subdirectories and their files---there is no need to create separate repositories nested within the `recipes` repository, whether subdirectories are present from the beginning or added later. Also, note that the creation of the `recipes` directory and its initialization as a repository are completely separate processes.

If we use `ls` to show the directory's contents, it appears that nothing has changed:

``` bash
ls
```

But if we add the `-a` flag to show everything, we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `recipes` called `.git`:

``` bash
ls -a
```

```output
.	..	.git
```

Git uses this special subdirectory to store all the information about the project, including the tracked files and sub-directories located within the project's directory. If we ever delete the `.git` subdirectory, we will lose the project's history.

We can now start using one of the most important git commands, which is particularly helpful to beginners. `git status` tells us the status of our project, and better, a list of changes in the project and options on what to do with those changes. We can use it as often as we want, whenever we want to understand what is going on.

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

If you are using a different version of `git`, the exact wording of the output might be slightly different.

## Challenge: Places to Create Git Repositories

Along with tracking information about recipes (the project we have already created), Alfredo would also like to track information about desserts specifically. Alfredo creates a `desserts` project inside his `recipes` project with the following sequence of commands:

``` bash
cd              # return to the home directory
cd recipes      # go into recipes directory, which is already a Git repository
ls -a           # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the recipes directory
mkdir desserts  # make a sub-directory recipes/desserts
cd desserts     # go into desserts subdirectory
git init        # make the desserts subdirectory a Git repository
ls -a           # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command, run inside the `desserts` subdirectory, required for tracking files stored in the `desserts` subdirectory?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
No. Alfredo does not need to make the `desserts` subdirectory a Git repository because the `recipes` repository will track all files, sub-directories, and subdirectory files under the `recipes` directory. Thus, in order to track all information about desserts, Alfredo only needed to add the `desserts` subdirectory to the `recipes` directory.

Additionally, Git repositories can interfere with each other if they are "nested": the outer repository will try to version-control the inner repository. Therefore, it's best to create each new Git repository in a separate directory. To be sure that there is no conflicting repository in the directory, check the output of `git status`. If it looks like the following, you are good to go to create a new repository as shown above:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
:::

## Correcting `git init` Mistakes

Jimmy explains to Alfredo how a nested repository is redundant and may cause confusion down the road. Alfredo would like to go back to a single git repository. How can Alfredo undo his last `git init` in the `desserts` subdirectory?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution: USE WITH CAUTION!" collapse="true"}

**Background**

Removing files from a Git repository needs to be done with caution. But we have not learned yet how to tell Git to track a particular file; we will learn this in the next episode. Files that are not tracked by Git can easily be removed like any other "ordinary" files with

``` bash
rm filename
```

Similarly a directory can be removed using `rm -r dirname`. If the files or folder being removed in this fashion are tracked by Git, then their removal becomes another change that we will need to track, as we will see in the next episode.

**Solution**

Git keeps all of its files in the `.git` directory. To recover from this little mistake, Alfredo can remove the `.git` folder in the desserts subdirectory by running the following command from inside the `recipes` directory:

``` bash
rm -rf desserts/.git
```

But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory will remove the entire Git history of a project you might want to keep. In general, deleting files and directories using `rm` from the command line cannot be reversed. Therefore, always check your current directory using the command `pwd`.

:::

# Tracking Changes

First let's make sure we're still in the right directory. You should be in the `recipes` directory.

``` bash
cd
cd recipes
```

Let's create a file called `guacamole.md` that contains the basic structure of our first recipe. We'll use VS Code to edit the file; you can use whatever editor you like.

``` bash
code guacamole.md
```

If `code` is not working via terminal, you can just use GUI to create a new file by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl+N`.


Type the text below into the `guacamole.md` file:

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
## Instructions
```

Save the file and exit your editor.

::: {.callout-note title="Markdown" collapse="true"}
Jimmy and Alfredo are using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to write their recipes. It is a simple plain-text format for writing lists, links and other things that might go into a web page.

| Markdown code | Rendered output |
|---|---|
| `*   Use asterisks` `*   to create` `*   bullet lists.` | - Use asterisks - to create - bullet lists. |
| `1.   Use numbers` `1.   to create` `1.   numbered lists.` | 1. Use numbers 2. to create 3. numbered lists. |
| `*  You can use indents` `   *  To create sublists` `   *  of the same type` | - You can use indents   - To create sublists   - of the same type |
| `# A Level-1 Heading` | ## A Level-1 Heading |
| `## A Level-2 Heading` | ### A Level-2 Heading |
:::

Let's verify that the file was properly created by running the list command (`ls`):

``` bash
ls
```

```output
guacamole.md
```

`guacamole.md` contains three lines, which we can see by running:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
## Instructions
```

If we check the status of our project again, Git tells us that it's noticed the new file:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	guacamole.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The "untracked files" message means that there's a file in the directory that Git isn't keeping track of. We can tell Git to track a file using `git add`:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
```

and then check that the right thing happened:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

	new file:   guacamole.md
```

Git now knows that it's supposed to keep track of `guacamole.md`, but it hasn't recorded these changes as a commit yet. To get it to do that, we need to run one more command:

``` bash
git commit -m "Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe"
```

```output
[main (root-commit) f22b25e] Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 guacamole.md
```

When we run `git commit`, Git takes everything we have told it to save by using `git add` and stores a copy permanently inside the special `.git` directory. This permanent copy is called a commit (or revision) and its short identifier is `f22b25e`. Your commit may have another identifier.

We use the `-m` flag (for "message") to record a short, descriptive, and specific comment that will help us remember later on what we did and why. If we just run `git commit` without the `-m` option, Git will launch VS Code editor (or whatever other editor we configured as `core.editor`) so that we can write a longer message.

Good commit messages start with a brief (less than 50 characters) statement about the changes made in the commit. Generally, the message should complete the sentence "If applied, this commit will" <commit message here>. If you want to go into more detail, add a blank line between the summary line and your additional notes. Use this additional space to explain why you made changes and/or what their impact will be.

If we run `git status` now:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

it tells us everything is up to date. If we want to know what we've done recently, we can ask Git to show us the project's history using `git log`:

``` bash
git log
```

```output
commit f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b
Author: Alfredo Linguini <a.linguini@ratatouille.fr>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 09:51:46 2013 -0400

    Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order. The listing for each commit includes the commit's full identifier (which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by the `git commit` command earlier), the commit's author, when it was created, and the log message Git was given when the commit was created.

::: {.callout-note title="Where Are My Changes?"}
If we run `ls` at this point, we will still see just one file called `guacamole.md`. That's because Git saves information about files' history in the special `.git` directory mentioned earlier so that our filesystem doesn't become cluttered (and so that we can't accidentally edit or delete an old version).
:::

Now suppose Alfredo adds more information to the file. (Again, we'll edit with `code` and then `cat` the file to show its contents; you may use a different editor, and don't need to `cat`.)

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lemon
* salt
## Instructions
```

When we run `git status` now, it tells us that a file it already knows about has been modified:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The last line is the key phrase: "no changes added to commit". We have changed this file, but we haven't told Git we will want to save those changes (which we do with `git add`) nor have we saved them (which we do with `git commit`). So let's do that now. It is good practice to always review our changes before saving them. We do this using `git diff`. This shows us the differences between the current state of the file and the most recently saved version:

``` bash
git diff
```

```output
diff --git a/guacamole.md b/guacamole.md
index df0654a..315bf3a 100644
--- a/guacamole.md
+++ b/guacamole.md
@@ -1,3 +1,6 @@
 # Guacamole
 ## Ingredients
+* avocado
+* lemon
+* salt
 ## Instructions
```

The output is cryptic because it is actually a series of commands for tools like editors and `patch` telling them how to reconstruct one file given the other. If we break it down into pieces:

1. The first line tells us that Git is producing output similar to the Unix `diff` command comparing the old and new versions of the file.
2. The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing; `df0654a` and `315bf3a` are unique computer-generated labels for those versions.
3. The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed.
4. The remaining lines are the most interesting, they show us the actual differences and the lines on which they occur. In particular, the `+` marker in the first column shows where we added a line.

After reviewing our change, it's time to commit it:

``` bash
git commit -m "Add ingredients for basic guacamole"
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Whoops: Git won't commit because we didn't use `git add` first. Let's fix that:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git commit -m "Add ingredients for basic guacamole"
```

```output
[main 34961b1] Add ingredients for basic guacamole
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

Git insists that we add files to the set we want to commit before actually committing anything. This allows us to commit our changes in stages and capture changes in logical portions rather than only large batches. For example, suppose we're adding a few citations to relevant research to our thesis. We might want to commit those additions, and the corresponding bibliography entries, but *not* commit some of our work drafting the conclusion (which we haven't finished yet).

To allow for this, Git has a special *staging area* where it keeps track of things that have been added to the current changeset but not yet committed.

::: {.callout-note title="Staging Area"}
If you think of Git as taking snapshots of changes over the life of a project, `git add` specifies *what* will go in a snapshot (putting things in the staging area), and `git commit` then *actually takes* the snapshot, and makes a permanent record of it (as a commit). If you don't have anything staged when you type `git commit`, Git will prompt you to use `git commit -a` or `git commit --all`, which is kind of like gathering *everyone* to take a group photo! However, it's almost always better to explicitly add things to the staging area, because you might commit changes you forgot you made. Try to stage things manually, or you might find yourself searching for "git undo commit" more than you would like!
:::

![](images/03_version-control__git-staging-area.svg){alt='A diagram showing how "git add" registers changes in the staging area, while "git commit" moves changes from the staging area to the repository'}

Let's watch as our changes to a file move from our editor to the staging area and into long-term storage. First, we'll improve our recipe by changing 'lemon' to 'lime':

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

``` bash
git diff
```

```output
diff --git a/guacamole.md b/guacamole.md

--- a/guacamole.md
+++ b/guacamole.md
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@

```

So far, so good: we've replaced one line (shown with a `-` in the first column) with a new line (shown with a `+` in the first column). Now let's put that change in the staging area and see what `git diff` reports:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git diff
```

There is no output: as far as Git can tell, there's no difference between what it's been asked to save permanently and what's currently in the directory. However, if we do this:

``` bash
git diff --staged
```

```

::: {.callout-note title="Word-based diffing"}
Sometimes, e.g. in the case of text documents a line-wise diff is too coarse. That is where the `--color-words` option of `git diff` comes in very useful as it highlights the changed words using colors.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Paging the Log"}
When the output of `git log` is too long to fit in your screen, `git` uses a program to split it into pages of the size of your screen. When this "pager" is called, you will notice that the last line in your screen is a `:`, instead of your usual prompt.

- To get out of the pager, press Q.
- To move to the next page, press Spacebar.
- To search for `some_word` in all pages, press `/` and type `some_word`. Navigate through matches pressing N.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Limit Log Size"}
To avoid having `git log` cover your entire terminal screen, you can limit the number of commits that Git lists by using `-N`, where `N` is the number of commits that you want to view. For example, if you only want information from the last commit you can use:

``` bash
git log -1
```

```output
commit 005937fbe2a98fb83f0ade869025dc2636b4dad5 (HEAD -> main)
Author: Alfredo Linguini <a.linguini@ratatouille.fr>
Date:   Thu Aug 22 10:14:07 2013 -0400

   Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
```

You can also reduce the quantity of information using the `--oneline` option:

``` bash
git log --oneline
```

```output
005937f (HEAD -> main) Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
34961b1 Add ingredients for basic guacamole
f22b25e Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```

You can also combine the `--oneline` option with others. One useful combination adds `--graph` to display the commit history as a text-based graph and to indicate which commits are associated with the current `HEAD`, the current branch `main`, or other Git references:

``` bash
git log --oneline --graph
```

```output
* 005937f (HEAD -> main) Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe
* 34961b1 Add ingredients for basic guacamole
* f22b25e Create initial structure for a Guacamole recipe
```
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Directories"}
Two important facts you should know about directories in Git.

1. Git does not track directories on their own, only files within them. Try it for yourself:

``` bash
mkdir cakes
git status
git add cakes
git status
```

Note, our newly created empty directory `cakes` does not appear in the list of untracked files even if we explicitly add it (via `git add`) to our repository. This is the reason why you will sometimes see `.gitkeep` files in otherwise empty directories. The sole purpose of `.gitkeep` files is to populate a directory so that Git adds it to the repository. The name `.gitkeep` is just a convention, and in fact, you can name these files anything you like.

2. If you create a directory in your Git repository and populate it with files, you can add all the files in the directory at once by referring to the directory in your `git add` command. Try it for yourself:

``` bash
touch cakes/brownie cakes/lemon_drizzle
git status
git add cakes
git status
```

Before moving on, we will commit these changes.

``` bash
git commit -m "Add some initial cakes"
```
:::

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository, we first need to add the changed files to the staging area (`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the repository (`git commit`):

![](images/03_version-control__git-committing.svg){alt='A diagram showing two documents being separately staged using git add, before being combined into one commit using git commit'}

## Challenge: Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the last commit made to `guacamole.md`?

1. "Changes"
2. "Change lemon for lime"
3. "Modify guacamole to the traditional recipe"

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear; and answer 2 is redundant to using "git diff" to see what changed in this commit; but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.
:::

## Challenge: Committing Changes to Git

Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt` to my local Git repository?

1. `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
2. `git init myfile.txt` then `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
3. `git add myfile.txt` then `git commit -m "my recent changes"`
4. `git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"`

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
2. Would try to create a new repository.
3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.
:::

## Challenge: Committing Multiple Files

When you make changes, they often belong together as one logical improvement. Git lets you group related edits into a single commit so your project stays consistent. This is something word processors can't easily do—each suggestion is separate, even if they depend on each other.

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

1. Add some text to `guacamole.md` noting the rough price of the ingredients.
2. Create a new file `groceries.md` with a list of products and their prices for different markets.
3. Add changes from both files to the staging area, and commit those changes.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
First we make our changes to the `guacamole.md` and `groceries.md` files:

``` bash
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado (1.35)
* lime (0.64)
* salt (2)
```

``` bash
cat groceries.md
```

```output
# Market A
* avocado: 1.35 per unit.
* lime: 0.64 per unit
* salt: 2 per kg
```

Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md groceries.md
```

Or with multiple commands:

``` bash
git add guacamole.md
git add groceries.md
```

Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:

``` bash
git commit -m "Write prices for ingredients and their source"
```

```output
[main cc127c2]
 Write prices for ingredients and their source
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 groceries.md
```
:::

## Challenge: `bio` Repository

- Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
- Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt`, commit your changes
- Modify one line, add a fourth line
- Display the differences between its updated state and its original state.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If needed, move out of the `recipes` folder:

``` bash
cd ..
```

Create a new folder called `bio` and 'move' into it:

``` bash
mkdir bio
cd bio
```

Initialise git:

``` bash
git init
```

Create your biography file `me.txt` using VS Code or another text editor. Once in place, add and commit it to the repository:

``` bash
git add me.txt
git commit -m "Add biography file"
```

Modify the file as described (modify one line, add a fourth line). To display the differences between its updated state and its original state, use `git diff`:

``` bash
git diff me.txt
```
:::

# Exploring History

As we saw in the previous episode, we can refer to commits by their identifiers. You can refer to the *most recent commit* of the working directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding small changes at a time to `guacamole.md`, so it's easy to track our progress by looking at it. Let's do that using our `HEAD`. Before we start, let's make a change to `guacamole.md`, adding yet another line.

``` bash
code guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
An ill-considered change
```

Now, let's see what we get.

``` bash
git diff HEAD guacamole.md
```

```output
diff --git a/guacamole.md b/guacamole.md

```

Note that `HEAD` is the default option for `git diff`, so omitting it will not change the command's output at all (give it a try). However, the real power of `git diff` lies in its ability to compare with previous commits. For example, by adding `~1` (where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**\-d*uh*]), we can look at the commit before `HEAD`.

``` bash
git diff HEAD~1 guacamole.md
```

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff` again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:

``` bash
git diff HEAD~2 guacamole.md
```

```output

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as well as the commit message, rather than the *differences* between a commit and our working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

``` bash
git show HEAD~2 guacamole.md
```

In this way, we can build up a chain of commits. The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`; we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation, so `HEAD~1` means "the previous commit", while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using those long strings of digits and letters that both `git log` and `git show` display. These are unique IDs for the changes, and "unique" really does mean unique: every change to any set of files on any computer has a unique 40-character identifier. Our first commit was given the ID `f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b`, so let's try this:

``` bash
git diff f22b25e3233b4645dabd0d81e651fe074bd8e73b guacamole.md

That's the right answer, but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying, so Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically seven for normal size projects):

All right! So we can save changes to files and see what we've changed. Now, how can we restore older versions of things? Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to `guacamole.md` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed, but those changes haven't been staged:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were by using `git restore`:

``` bash
git restore guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

As you might guess from its name, `git restore` restores an old version of a file. By default, it recovers the version of the file recorded in `HEAD`, which is the last saved commit. If we want to go back even further, we can use a commit identifier instead, using `-s` option:

``` bash
git restore -s f22b25e guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
## Instructions
```

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
    modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Notice that the changes are not currently in the staging area, and have not been committed. If we wished, we can put things back the way they were at the last commit by using `git restore` to overwrite the working copy with the last committed version:

``` bash
git restore guacamole.md
cat guacamole.md
```

```output
# Guacamole
## Ingredients
* avocado
* lime
* salt
## Instructions
```

It's important to remember that we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository *before* the change we're trying to undo. A common mistake is to use the number of the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard. In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`. We use the `.` to mean all files:

![](images/03_version-control__git-restore.svg){alt='A diagram showing how git restore can be used to restore the previous version of two files'}

So, to put it all together, here's how Git works in cartoon form:

![](images/03_version-control__git_staging.svg){alt='A diagram showing the entire git workflow: local changes are staged using git add, applied to the local repository using git commit, and can be restored from the repository using git restore'}

The fact that files can be reverted one by one tends to change the way people organize their work. If everything is in one large document, it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion. If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files, on the other hand, moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.

## Challenge: Recovering Older Versions of a File

Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the modifications she made this morning "broke" the script and it no longer runs. She has spent approximately 1 hour trying to fix it, with no luck...

Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! Which commands below will let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called `data_cruncher.py`?

1. `git restore`
2. `git restore data_cruncher.py`
3. `git restore -s HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`
4. `git restore -s <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`
5. Both 2 and 4

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The answer is (5) - Both 2 and 4.

The `restore` command restores files from the repository, overwriting the files in your working directory. Answers 2 and 4 both restore the *latest* version *in the repository* of the file `data_cruncher.py`. Answer 2 uses `HEAD` to indicate the *latest*, whereas answer 4 uses the unique ID of the last commit, which is what `HEAD` means.

Answer 3 gets the version of `data_cruncher.py` from the commit *before* `HEAD`, which is NOT what we wanted.

Answer 1 results in an error. You need to specify a file to restore. If you want to restore all files you should use `git restore .`
:::

## Challenge: Reverting a Commit

Jennifer is collaborating with colleagues on her Python script. She realizes her last commit to the project's repository contained an error, and wants to undo it. Jennifer wants to undo correctly so everyone in the project's repository gets the correct change. The command `git revert [erroneous commit ID]` will create a new commit that reverses the erroneous commit.

The command `git revert` is different from `git restore -s [commit ID] .` because `git restore` returns the files not yet committed within the local repository to a previous state, whereas `git revert` reverses changes committed to the local and project repositories.

Below are the right steps and explanations for Jennifer to use `git revert`. What is the missing command?

1. `________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID`
2. Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).
3. `git revert [commit ID]`
4. Type in the new commit message.
5. Save and close.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The command `git log` lists project history with commit IDs.

The command `git show HEAD` shows changes made at the latest commit, and lists the commit ID; however, Jennifer should double-check it is the correct commit, and no one else has committed changes to the repository.
:::

## Challenge: Understanding Workflow and History

What is the output of the last command in the following sequence?

``` bash
cd recipes
echo "I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup" > ketchup.md
git add ketchup.md
echo "ketchup enhances pasta dishes" >> ketchup.md
git commit -m "My opinions about the red sauce"
git restore ketchup.md
cat ketchup.md
```

1. ```output
   ketchup enhances pasta dishes
   ```

2. ```output
   I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup
   ```

3. ```output
   I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup
   ketchup enhances pasta dishes
   ```

4. ```output
   Error because you have changed ketchup.md without committing the changes
   ```

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The answer is 2.

The changes to the file from the second `echo` command are only applied to the working copy, not the version in the staging area. The command `git add ketchup.md` places the current version of `ketchup.md` into the staging area.

So, when `git commit -m "My opinions about the red sauce"` is executed, the version of `ketchup.md` committed to the repository is the one from the staging area and has only one line.

At this time, the working copy still has the second line (and `git status` will show that the file is modified). However, `git restore ketchup.md` replaces the working copy with the most recently committed version of `ketchup.md`. So, `cat ketchup.md` will output:

```output
I like tomatoes, therefore I like ketchup
```
:::

## Challenge: Checking Understanding of `git diff`

Consider this command: `git diff HEAD~9 guacamole.md`. What do you predict this command will do if you execute it? What happens when you do execute it? Why?

Try another command, `git diff [ID] guacamole.md`, where [ID] is replaced with the unique identifier for your most recent commit. What do you think will happen, and what does happen?

## Challenge: Getting Rid of Staged Changes

`git restore` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed? Make a change to `guacamole.md`, add that change using `git add`, then use `git restore` to see if you can remove your change.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
After adding a change, `git restore` cannot be used directly. Let's look at the output of `git status`:

```output
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   guacamole.md
```

Note that if you don't have the same output, you may either have forgotten to change the file, or you have added it *and* committed it.

Using the command `git restore guacamole.md` now does not give an error, but it does not restore the file either. Git helpfully tells us that we need to use `git restore --staged` first to unstage the file:

``` bash
git restore --staged guacamole.md
```

Now, `git status` gives us:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   guacamole.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

This means we can now use `git restore` to restore the file to the previous commit:

``` bash
git restore guacamole.md
git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
:::

## Challenge: Explore and Summarize Histories

Exploring history is an important part of Git, and often it is a challenge to find the right commit ID, especially if the commit is from several months ago.

Imagine the `recipes` project has more than 50 files. You would like to find a commit that modifies some specific text in `guacamole.md`. When you type `git log`, a very long list appeared. How can you narrow down the search?

Recall that the `git diff` command allows us to explore one specific file, e.g., `git diff guacamole.md`. We can apply a similar idea here.

``` bash
git log guacamole.md
```

Unfortunately some of these commit messages are very ambiguous, e.g., `update files`. How can you search through these files?

Both `git diff` and `git log` are very useful and they summarize a different part of the history for you. Is it possible to combine both? Let's try the following:

``` bash
git log --patch guacamole.md
```

You should get a long list of output, and you should be able to see both commit messages and the difference between each commit.

Question: What does the following command do?

``` bash
git log --patch HEAD~9 *.md
```

# Ignoring Things

What if we have files that we do not want Git to track for us, like backup files created by our editor or intermediate files created during data analysis? Let's create a few dummy files:

``` bash
mkdir pictures
touch a.png b.png c.png pictures/cake1.jpg pictures/cake2.jpg
```

and see what Git says:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	a.png
	b.png
	c.png
	pictures/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Putting these files under version control would be a waste of disk space. What's worse, having them all listed could distract us from changes that actually matter, so let's tell Git to ignore them.

We do this by creating a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`:

``` bash
code .gitignore
```

Type the text below into the `.gitignore` file:

```output
*.png
pictures/
```

Save the file and exit your editor.

Verify that the file contains the files to ignore.

``` bash
cat .gitignore
```

```output
*.png
pictures/
```

These patterns tell Git to ignore any file whose name ends in `.png` and everything in the `pictures` directory. (If any of these files were already being tracked, Git would continue to track them.)

Once we have created this file, the output of `git status` is much cleaner:

``` bash
git status
```

```output
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

The only thing Git notices now is the newly-created `.gitignore` file. You might think we wouldn't want to track it, but everyone we're sharing our repository with will probably want to ignore the same things that we're ignoring. Let's add and commit `.gitignore`:

``` bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore png files and the pictures folder."
git status
```

```output
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

As a bonus, using `.gitignore` helps us avoid accidentally adding files to the repository that we don't want to track:

``` bash
git add a.png
```

```output
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
a.png
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```

If we really want to override our ignore settings, we can use `git add -f` to force Git to add something. For example, `git add -f a.png`. We can also always see the status of ignored files if we want:

``` bash
git status --ignored
```

```output
On branch main
Ignored files:
 (use "git add -f <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        a.png
        b.png
        c.png
        pictures/

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Challenge: Ignoring Nested Files

Given a directory structure that looks like:

``` bash
pictures/cake
pictures/pizza
```

How would you ignore only `pictures/cake` and not `pictures/pizza`?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If you only want to ignore the contents of `pictures/cake`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore only the `/cake/` subfolder by adding the following line to your `.gitignore`:

```output
pictures/cake/
```

This line will ensure only the contents of `pictures/cake` is ignored, and not the contents of `pictures/pizza`.

As with most programming issues, there are a few alternative ways that one may ensure this ignore rule is followed. Further, the discussion pages have more detail on ignore rules.
:::

## Challenge: Including Specific Files

How would you ignore all `.png` files in your root directory except for `final.png`?

Hint: Find out what `!` (the exclamation point operator) does

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
You would add the following two lines to your `.gitignore`:

```output
*.png           # ignore all png files
!final.png      # except final.png
```

The exclamation point operator will include a previously excluded entry.

Note also that, if you've previously committed `.png` files in this lesson, they will not be ignored with this new rule. Only future additions of `.png` files to the root directory will be ignored.

## Challenge: Ignoring Nested Files: Variation

Given a directory structure that looks similar to the earlier Nested Files exercise, but with a slightly different directory structure:

``` bash
pictures/cake
pictures/pizza
pictures/pie
pictures/brownie
```

How would you ignore all of the contents in the pictures folder, but not `pictures/pie`?

Hint: think a bit about how you created an exception with the `!` operator before.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
If you want to ignore the contents of `pictures/` but not those of `pictures/pie/`, you can change your `.gitignore` to ignore the contents of pictures folder, but create an exception for the contents of the `pictures/pie` subfolder. Your `.gitignore` would look like this:

```output
pictures/*              # ignore everything in pictures folder
!pictures/pie/          # do not ignore pictures/pie/ contents
```

## Challenge: Ignoring all data Files in a Directory

Assuming you have an empty `.gitignore` file, and given a directory structure that looks like:

``` bash
pictures/data/location/gps/a.dat
pictures/data/location/gps/b.dat
pictures/data/location/gps/c.dat
pictures/data/location/gps/info.txt
pictures/plots
```

What's the shortest `.gitignore` rule you could write to ignore all `.dat` files in `pictures/data/location/gps`? Do not ignore the `info.txt`.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
Appending `pictures/data/location/gps/*.dat` will match every file in `pictures/data/location/gps` that ends with `.dat`. The file `pictures/data/location/gps/info.txt` will not be ignored.

## Challenge: Ignoring all data Files in the repository

Let us assume you have many `.csv` files in different subdirectories of your repository. For example, you might have:

``` bash
results/a.csv
data/experiment_1/b.csv
data/experiment_2/c.csv
data/experiment_2/variation_1/d.csv
```

How do you ignore all the `.csv` files, without explicitly listing the names of the corresponding folders?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
In the `.gitignore` file, write:

```output
**/*.csv
```

This will ignore all the `.csv` files, regardless of their position in the directory tree. You can still include some specific exception with the exclamation point operator.

## Challenge: The Order of Rules

Given a `.gitignore` file with the following contents:

```output
*.csv
!*.csv
```

What will be the result?

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
The `!` modifier will negate an entry from a previously defined ignore pattern. Because the `!*.csv` entry negates all of the previous `.csv` files in the `.gitignore`, none of them will be ignored, and all `.csv` files will be tracked.

## Challenge: Log Files

You wrote a script that creates many intermediate log-files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, `log_03`, etc. You want to keep them but you do not want to track them through `git`.

1. Write **one** `.gitignore` entry that excludes files of the form `log_01`, `log_02`, etc.
2. Test your "ignore pattern" by creating some dummy files of the form `log_01`, etc.
3. You find that the file `log_01` is very important after all, add it to the tracked files without changing the `.gitignore` again.
4. Discuss with your neighbor what other types of files could reside in your directory that you do not want to track and thus would exclude via `.gitignore`.

::: {.callout-note title="Solution" collapse="true"}
1. Append either `log_*` or `log*` as a new entry in your `.gitignore`
2. Track `log_01` using `git add -f log_01`
